# Stage 8 - Aquatics / Life Saving / Swift Water Rescue

## Plan>

### I can create a rescue plan with detailed risk management strategies for a mock emergency with my group.

The youth member should decide on a mock emergency and then create a plan, with detailed risk management, with their Patrol or Unit. Their simulated rescue should be of someone caught in either a tidal rip or fast flowing river water. They should also plan a range of methods to release an entrapped victim.


### I know how to tether a craft to perform a rescue or recovery, where appropriate.

The youth member should demonstrate this skill and share their knowledge on how to correctly and safely tether craft with their Patrol. This could be learned or demonstrated on a swift water/white water skills development session/weekend.


## Do>

### I have successfully completed the Wilderness First Aid Skill set.

The youth member must have completed the Wilderness First Aid skill set. This can be through a course with an accredited provider or by other means, such as Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) through SAIT or other providers. For the purposes of the Outdoor Adventure Skills, a Wilderness First Aid course consists of SIS training package's Wilderness First Aid skillset (SISSS00126), or its replacement: 
 * HLTAID011 Provide first aid 
 * SISOFLD004 Provide first aid in remote locations 
 * SISXEMR002 Coordinate emergency responses.

- HLTAID011 Provide first aid
- SISOFLD004 Provide first aid in remote locations
- SISXEMR002 Coordinate emergency responses.


### I can perform a simulated rescue of someone caught in either a tidal rip or fast flowing river water.

The youth member should undertake the rescue plan they have created with their Patrol or Unit and successfully carry out rescuing a patient. Ideally this would be conducted 2-3 times to appropriately demonstrate their skills and knowledge on this.


### I can identify and use a range of methods to release an entrapment victim, according to the situation, type of entrapment and organizational policies and procedures.

The youth member should be able to discuss and use the range of methods from their swift water planning to release an entrapped victim. They should note this in their logbook and indicate what methods they used, the type of entrapment and the participants in the mock emergency.


### I can lead and communicate directions to other members of the rescue team.

The youth member should be able to lead a rescue team and communicate directions to other members to successfully undertake a rescue in mock or real circumstances. This will be evident if members of the rescue patrol know their role, what to do when, and all work well together as a team.


### I have been involved in water rescue drills which involve the use of mechanical haul systems.

The youth member should undertake water rescue drills involving the use of a mechanical haul system. They should note the techniques and scenario of the drills in their logbook, and have it signed by their verifier.


## Review>

### I have completed and logged at least five water incidents (real or mock) where I have been the lead First Aider.

The youth member should undertake at least five water incidents where they are acting as the lead first aider on the scene. They will need to Plan>, Do> and Review> these incidents and note them in their logbook for verification by a suitably skilled mentor.
