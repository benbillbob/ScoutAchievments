# Stage 7 - Aquatics / Life Saving / Swift Water Rescue

## Plan>

### I know basic management of a suspected spinal injury in shallow water.

The youth member should demonstrate understanding by discussing the basic management of a suspected spinal injury in shallow water. They should then put it into practice when they Do> simulated rescues.


### I understand the laws concerning acceptance of responsibility as a first aider.

The youth member should demonstrate understanding by discussing 'duty of care' which is a legal obligation, and once they start treatment they are accepting a responsibility to care for that person. This statement may require some research, prior conversations and simulated mock emergencies.


### I know how to use bystanders in an emergency situation.

The youth member should be able to discuss how they would use bystanders in an emergency situation in order to reduce the risks and to aid the situation. They will consider type of person, personality type, and how to engage them properly. They should then put this into practice when they Do> their simulated rescues.


## Do>

### I have completed a swift water safety half day worth of learning and drills.

The youth member should write this training in their logbook. A half day is approximately 3 hours. They should outline the learning and drills that they participated in, the conditions they faced and who was present.


### I can swim 200 meters fully clothed using a range of different strokes.

The youth member can choose the combination of strokes they wish to use: freestyle, backstroke, breaststroke, sidestroke, survival backstroke. This skill is important for when they are not specifically involved in an activity and determine someone needs immediate assistance and removing clothing is time they don't necessarily have. It is also important should they find themselves needing to swim when they weren't expecting to.


### I have performed two simulated rescues showing techniques of how to avoid contact with violent patients and defence methods and releases where necessary.

The youth member should write their rescues in their logbook, including the scenarios and what techniques they used to rescue the patients. They should remember their 4A's, learned in Stage 3, when performing any rescues.


### I can recognise particular hazards in swiftly flowing water, and identify appropriate actions and locations and formations where the danger is reduced.

The youth member should demonstrate this skill by pointing out and discussing hazards in the field with a two-up peer or suitably skilled mentor. They may also do a scenario in relation to this statement in their rescue skills half day.


### I have led a group to demonstrate the huddle position and can explain the theory behind the H.E.L.P position.

The youth member should lead a Patrol, demonstrating the HELP position. Scouts in Stage 3 need to use the Heat Exposure Lessening Position and this technique is reinforced in Stage 5. Therefore, it would be ideal if they could assist Scouts in either Stage 3 or 5 to understand the theory behind this position and learn the correct technique.


### I can demonstrate effective CPR in an outdoors water environment.

The youth member could do this in a simulated rescue situation and write it in their logbook, ensuring they outline the scenario and who was involved. Ideally, this would be done with a local surf club as a skills session, or in conjunction with a recertification for CPR.


### I can swim 400 metres continuously (consisting of 100 metres each of freestyle, breaststroke, survival backstroke and sidestroke) within 13 minutes.

The youth member should demonstrate swimming 400 meters continuously using each of the mentioned strokes. They should write it in their logbook. They may choose to video it to show to their two-up peer at a later date.


### I can swim 50 metres then tow a patient 50 metres, within 3 minutes and 15 seconds.

The youth member should demonstrate successfully towing a patient 50 metres, ensuring that their face is clear of the water when doing so.


### I have demonstrated initiative in rescuing two people who are in difficulty up to 15 meters from safety.

The youth member can do this through a simulated rescue where they are unaware of who would require assistance. They should always write these rescues in their logbook and indicate what the scenario was, what they did and how they could improve next time.


## Review>

### I can provide feedback to a patrol of Scouts that I have led on a water safety program on what we can improve on for the future.

The youth member should have a review at the end of the activity and provide constructive feedback to the Scouts on how to improve the activity, including their water safety skills and teamwork.


## Verify

### My logbook is up to date at the end of this stage.


### Upload supporting documents

_Each file should be less than 10MB in size._
