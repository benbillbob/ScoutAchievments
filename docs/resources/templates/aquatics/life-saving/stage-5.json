Every situation is different and they need to make sure they don't end up needing rescuing too, which is why the 4A's is a very important process to think about before starting a rescue. If the incident is non-life threatening and injury has occurred, then administer DRSABCD. If it is life-threating, then contact 000. They should also consider how they may seek help from those around them."

Ensure they approach the unconscious person feet first, talking to them as they approach and gently tap them with their foot to see if they get a response. The scenario would depend on if they saw the incident which caused them to lose consciousness, assuming that there is no risk of spinal damage, they should roll them over and keep their face out of the water. Ideally they should use a facemask and give them rescue breaths whilst swimming them to the edge of the body of water. They may need to talk through potential scenarios with a more experienced/skilled water safety person, and run through a range of mock emergencies to build the skill required."

They should then consider the risks that may come from these hazards and how they will mitigate these on an activity. This step could be done as a Patrol or individual before an ocean or large body of water trip."
