# Stage 5 - Aquatics / Surfing

## Plan>

### I know how to identify food and water requirements for a surfing session.

The youth member should consider how they might identify the needs of particular trips given people, location, weather and season. 
They should be able to: 
 * Specify how much water to carry 
 * Specify how many of each meal they will need (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks) and for how many people (this will be dependent on how long their day activity goes for) 
 * Identify suitable foods for surfing with regard to energy content, durability, perishability, and deliciousness. Should they have warm food, depending on the people and temperature of the water? 
 * Estimate overall energy requirements: how strenuous is the session?  Will it make them eat more?

- Identify suitable foods for surfing with regard to energy content, durability, perishability, and deliciousness. Should they have warm food, depending on the people and temperature of the water?
- Estimate overall energy requirements: how strenuous is the session?  Will it make them eat more?


### I can select beach access routes that minimise damage to the environment.

The youth member should demonstrate understanding in their plan that they are able to select appropriate beach access routes, taking into consideration tide times and depth of the reefs to ensure there is enough water not to touch the reef or bottom, to ensure minimal damage to the environment.


### I can identify possible hazards associated with surfing and procedures to minimise risks.

The youth member should identify the difference between a hazard and a risk. They should provide a hazard assessment and will need to account for: 
 * Human hazards 
 * Environmental hazards 
 * Equipment hazards 
 
They should include in their plan what steps they will take to minimise these hazards during an activity. They should then consider the risks that may come from these hazards and how they will mitigate these on an activity. This step could be done as a Patrol or individually before a surfing trip.

- Human hazards
- Environmental hazards
- Equipment hazards


### I know where sources of information about surfing equipment selection can be gained.

The youth member should research and provide sources of information about selecting appropriate surfing equipment for their planned activity.


### I can help choose a suitable surfing destination.

The youth member should help research and decide on a suitable location for surfing, taking into consideration tide times, swell, riptides, visibility, and their Patrol. Their surfing activity needs to be fun and engaging. If the surf is too intense, or not big enough, then it won't meet the expectations of the Patrol. They also need to consider entry and exit points and any hazards on the beach or in the surf. Their decision should also take into consideration their Patrol and their fitness and experience levels. Travel distances and times may also impact their plan.


### I can outline safety procedures and safe areas and or boundaries for the surfing session.

The youth member should ensure that they know what to do and how to safely recover when they wipe out while surfing. Ideally, they won't wipe out and to reduce the risk of doing so they should assess the conditions before they enter the water and make sure the waves are not beyond their limit. They should demonstrate patience watching the surf for at least 15 minutes to observe a few sets of waves and understand the ocean rhythm. They should always know where their board is and use their arms to protect themselves from their board when they wipeout. They should also keep their eyes open, being aware of where everyone is at all times. With this knowledge gained through observation, they can outline safer areas for their surfing session.


### I understand how to deal with marine creatures if I interact with them.

The youth member should be able to discuss what you would do if you encountered any marine creatures local to your surfing activity area, especially if they are dangerous to them. They should remember the minimal impact and leave no trace principles.


## Do>

### I have successfully completed* a Provide First Aid (including CPR) course from a recognised provider.

The youth member should complete a first aid course through an accredited provider. The first aid course should cover similar content to Provide First Aid (HLTAID011) or the current workplace first aid qualification. They could do a higher first aid unit, such as Provide Advanced First Aid or Provide First Aid in a remote location. 
 
*Members under the age of 14 may be able to participate in Provide First Aid courses, but may not necessarily receive the formal Units of Competency depending on provider.


### I can demonstrate monitoring basic manoeuvres and surfing techniques to ensure the safety of myself and other participants.

The youth member should put this in their log book, once they have demonstrated this skill, and get their two-up peer or other skilled surfer to verify it.


### I have practiced safely wiping out three times.

The youth member should ensure that they know what to do and how to safely recover when they wipe out while surfing. They should jump away from their board, never in front of it. They should try and do a cannon ball style jump, bottom first and tuck into the foetal position, trying to protect their face with their hands. Most importantly stay calm. They should try and get as low as possible to the bottom of the ocean where the surge is calmer, and then come up slowly with one arm on their head for protection. Once they have re-surfaced, they should grab their board and get back on.


### I can catch broken waves demonstrating control and basic surfing manoeuvres without wiping out.

The youth member should put this in their log book once they have successfully managed basic surfing manoeuvres without wiping out, and get their two-up peer or other skilled surfer to verify it.


### I understand effect of wind, tide, swell and ocean floors on surf conditions and adapt my activities to suit.

The youth member should be able to demonstrate understanding by discussing the effect of wind, tide, swell and ocean floors on surf conditions. They may discuss this with peers at a similar level or put together a short teaching plan for members working on Stage 3 who are interested in surfing.


### I can implement a suitable communication system for participants to use while surfing.

The youth member should understand different communication methods and be able to clearly implement them with their Patrol in their surfing activity. They will then need to implement a communication system for a surf activity that they are participating in.


### I understand surf survival skills and can demonstrate self rescue techniques.

The youth member should understand different survival methods and skills for surfing, and be able to demonstrate these clearly in surf conditions to their two-up peer, or other skilled surfer. Once completed, they should log their rescue practice in their logbook, indicating the scenario and conditions.


### I have completed 7 activities of surfing by the end of Stage 5 with a minimum of 7 hours in the water.

The youth member needs to complete at least seven (7) surfing activities and ensure the details are in their logbook. For surfing activities, this includes preparation, surfing for at least 1 hour and pack up. If their surf is for shorter then 1 hour, count the activity as the number of minutes surfed (i.e. 15 min, 30 min, 45 min). In their log they should include where they did the activities, who they did it with, what the weather was like, and any other interesting information about their activity.


### I can demonstrate assessing equipment for safety and suitability and adjust and fit to ensure personal comfort.

The youth member should understand different methods for assessing the safety and suitability of equipment, to clearly demonstrate these with their Patrol, focusing on their comfort in the activity.


## Review>

### I can review my own surfing skills development and identify potential improvements.

The youth member should think about their activities and what they are able to achieve so that they can work out what they could improve upon for future surfing activities.


## Verify

### My logbook is up to date at the end of this stage.
