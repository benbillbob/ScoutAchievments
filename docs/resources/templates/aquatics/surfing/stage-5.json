They should demonstrate patience watching the surf for at least 15 minutes to observe a few sets of waves and understand the ocean rhythm. They should always know where their board is and use their arms to protect themselves from their board when they wipeout. They should also keep their eyes open, being aware of where everyone is at all times. With this knowledge gained through observation, they can outline safer areas for their surfing session."
