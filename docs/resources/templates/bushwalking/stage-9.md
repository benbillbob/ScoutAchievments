# Stage 9 - Bushwalking

## Plan>

### I have kept my First Aid qualifications up to date.

The youth member should have a first aid qualification through an accredited provider and be able to provide certificates currency. 
 
The main requirement is to have keep the wilderness first aid skill set up to date and make sure the youth members CPR, First Aid and wilderness first aid is not out of date.


### I can lead the budget, preparation and manage every aspect of a weeklong expedition with a small Patrol.

This Journey should consist of 6 nights 7 days. Walking time should be between 6 and 8 hours a day walking not including rest breaks. Allowances can be made for travelling home for some portion of the last day. 
 
This should include as a minimum: 
 * A transport plan 
 * List of individual gear for participants
 * list of group gear 
 * Menu 
 * Food list (note that this is different to a menu) 
 * Risk assessment 
 * Route plan, including grid references for checkpoints, and distance and magnetic bearings between them 
 * Emergency plan including contact details and contingency plans 
 
These should be customised for a specific walk at a specific time of year, and not simply be generic. They may be consolidated into an overall activity plan.

- A transport plan
- List of individual gear for participants
- list of group gear
- Menu
- Food list (note that this is different to a menu)
- Risk assessment
- Route plan, including grid references for checkpoints, and distance and magnetic bearings between them
- Emergency plan including contact details and contingency plans


### I can develop a detailed risk management plan for an expedition involving challenging terrain for a period of 7 days or more.

Youth member must use the current ISO process or Australian Standard for risk management (currently AS/NZS ISO 31000: 2009). The youth member must show evidence that they have consulted with experts on risks specific to the area, such as local rangers. It is not acceptable for the youth member to simply use a template to generate the plan.


### I have organised a navigation training day for Scouts at Stage 5, 6 and 7 to teach them to navigate in a broad range of unmodified areas and conditions to determine their location and potential hazards.

The youth member must plan, organise, and deliver a day-long navigation activity for Scouts at Stage 5/6/7. The activity must include a half-day instructional component which the youth member leads. The remaining half-day can be spent supervising a practical navigation activity for the Stage 5/6/7 youth members.


## Do>

### I can conduct field repairs on my personal and group equipment as required for various bushwalking expeditions.

The youth member should be able to repair a wide range of bushwalking gear using tools and materials commonly available in the field (folding knife or multi-tool; electrical tape; cable ties; wire; etc). They must demonstrate one of the following: 
 * Fixing a broken walking boot with proper repair equipment  
 * Repairing a broken shoulder strap on a backpack with proper repair equipment 
 * Repairing seam seal on a tent that has de laminated with proper repair equipment 
 
Other examples of repairs they may demonstrate could include: 
 * Clearing a blocked gas jet 
 * Improvising a backpack waist strap 
 * Splinting a broken tent pole, and 
 * Replacing the pivot on a snowshoe.

- Replacing the pivot on a snowshoe.


### I have navigated in a broad range of untracked or unmodified landscapes.

The youth member will have acted as leader or navigator of a party walking off-track, as shown in their logbook, in at least three of the following environments during the day and three at night: 
 * Desert 
 * Scrub or coastal heath 
 * Woodland or forest 
 * Rainforest 
 * Ridgelines 
 * Mountain or alpine, or 
 * Snow. 
 
The day and night environments may be the same, different, or overlap. 
 
The youth member may navigate in the same environment during both day and night on the same walk; for example, an orienteering exercise which begins at midday and continues until midnight would cover both.

- Desert
- Scrub or coastal heath
- Woodland or forest
- Rainforest
- Ridgelines
- Mountain or alpine, or
- Snow.


### I have demonstrated the ability to check equipment for working condition, safety and suitability, according to relevant legislation and manufacturer recommendations.

The youth member should be able to check that all bushwalking equipment is in working condition, including: 
 * Checking self-inflating mattresses and repairing any leaks 
 * Replace o-ring seals in pressure stoves (dangerous!).

- Checking self-inflating mattresses and repairing any leaks
- Replace o-ring seals in pressure stoves (dangerous!).


### I am responsible for others in various situations on bushwalking expeditions for 6 nights or more.

The youth member must demonstrate, using their logbook, that they have been responsible as party leader for parties of dependent participants (such as a Scout Unit, for example) on overnight bushwalks for a total of at least six nights.


### I have applied clear and accurate instructional techniques to impart activity specific knowledge, bushwalking skills and safety procedures during a bushwalking session.

The youth member should have instructed other Scouts in three skills: 
 * An advanced navigation technique selected by the youth member such as changing the datum on a GPS, correcting for magnetic declination, or taking a back bearing as well as being the assessor for Stage 6 Scouts or below in some of their field work  
 * A safety or rescue technique such as using a throw-bag to protect a river crossing, or setting a hand-line, and 
 * One other technique of the youth member’s choice. 
 
The youth member must deliver the instruction in an accurate and unambiguous manner which is clearly understood by the Scout.

- An advanced navigation technique selected by the youth member such as changing the datum on a GPS, correcting for magnetic declination, or taking a back bearing as well as being the assessor for Stage 6 Scouts or below in some of their field work
- A safety or rescue technique such as using a throw-bag to protect a river crossing, or setting a hand-line, and
- One other technique of the youth member’s choice.


### I have supported another Scout up to Stage 7 requirements in Bushwalking.

During Stage 9 the youth member should have other Scouts they are mentoring through lower stages, including Stages 6 and 7 requirements. They should focus on supporting/facilitating other youth members learning in this Stage, which may include stepping back from providing all the instruction in lower Stages.


### I have bushwalked at least 300km by the end of Stage 9.

Youth member must demonstrate this using their logbook. The total distance may include the distance walked on snowshoes, but not on skis.


## Review>

### I have given a presentation to a group of Scouts on the skills I have gained from completing the Bushwalking Outdoor Adventure Skills.

The youth member's presentation should be a review of their Stage 1-9 journey through OAS - Bushwalking. It should cover the planning, undertaking and learnings that they have experienced throughout their Bushwalking adventures that they have led and assisted with. The presentation itself could be in any form, a video blog, PowerPoint presentation, visual or verbal presentation, bearing in mind that the aim of the presentation is to encourage those that watch it to be inspired to pursue Bushwalking.


### I have considered what I would like to do with the level of skill I have gained through the Bushwalking stream of the Outdoor Adventure Skills, and discussed it with a trusted mentor.

The youth member should discuss with their mentor both their physical and mental skills that they have developed and the challenges they have overcome since deciding to start on their bushwalking journey. They should also consider their goals moving forward, where will bushwalking take them and how can they share these skills and learnings within their Scouting community.
