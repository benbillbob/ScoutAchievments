All ingredients should be dry or reasonably light; for example, pasta sauce in a jar would not be appropriate, but it would be acceptable if it was sold in robust plastic packaging. The meals should also be nutritious and support alot of energy use and exercise for example in summer some high salt content food at the end of the day is not a bad idea to avoid cramping muscles with the right amount of water."
