 * When your call is answered you will be asked if you need Police, Fire or Ambulance. If requested by the operator, state your town and location. 
 * Your call will be directed to the service you asked for. When connected to the emergency service, stay on the line, speak clear and answer the questions. 
 * Don't hang up until the operator tells you to do so. 
 
Providing location information:

## Do>

### I can demonstrate basic safe food handling and the importance of hygiene at camp.

The youth member has participated in activities which demonstrate the difference between proper and improper hygiene principles at camp. This can be demonstrated, talked about or thought about by the youth member and brought back to the Unit.

 * not spraying aerosols in the tents, 
 * not leaving the tent unzipped, 
 * hanging up wet clothes, 
 * putting shoes at the door inside, 
 * only going in their own tent, 
 * staying a safe distance form the fire place, 
 * not throwing things in the fire and only placing appropriate materials in the fire. 
 
It is important the youth member understands why to do these things not just how to do them.

- putting shoes at the door inside,

The youth member should be able to un-zip a sleeping bag and place it in an appropriate place for airing (shade or light sun, cross breeze away from moisture). The youth member should be able to talk about sweating, hygiene, and the difference between something that can be washed regularly or not.


### I have spent two nights on camp in a tent at this stage.

The youth member should spent two nights at camp. This does not matter if it is consecutive or not. Remember that this will need to be logged in their log book.


### I can help set up a tent and identify the main parts of a tent.

The youth member has demonstrated helping set up a tent they have slept in and can name the base, fly, poles, pegs, guy ropes and locate, when putting up the tent, its door, air vents, vestibule, and other key features.


## Review>

### I can talk about what I enjoyed, learnt, and improved upon from at least two camps.

The youth member should be able to Review> their experiences from camp and talk about the things listed. If the youth member would like to talk with a peer, adult, one person or many that does not matter. It's more about the youth member's reflection than anything else. The SPICES cards or Review> Ball would be useful during this Review> period.


### I can suggest what I would do differently on a future camp to enjoy it more, to be safer, or to learn new things.

The youth member, similarly to the above Review> point, should reflect on their experience and come up with suggestions to make it better or safer. This does not need to be a hard task and could be as simple as commenting on the fire or guy line placement, hygiene standards, having different activities, and also why these suggestions are being made.
