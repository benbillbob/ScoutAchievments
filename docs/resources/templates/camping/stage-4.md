# Stage 4 - Camping

## Plan>

### I can prepare equipment, where required, for safe transportation to an activity location.

The youth member needs to demonstrate proper preparation of equipment for transportation and support packing a car/trailer, ensuring gear is kept safe from items that might destroy them or that could put the people transporting the goods in danger.


### I can identify appropriate campsites.

During the Plan> stage of the camping adventure, the youth member should identify the requirements for the campsite. 
Secondly, choose a campsite that will have a minimal or as minimal as possible impact on the environment. 
Follow the leave no trace principles while you are on location. 
Next, make sure that the space you are choosing has a flat, open and unobstructed area for the tents to be set up, without any overhanging branches, ant nests or other natural hazards nearby. 
Finally, make sure that there are adequate facilities, or flexible spaces, for all the members of your camp to utilise during their camping adventure.


### I know how to select equipment and protective clothing according to expected weather conditions.

Youth members should consider common challenging weather conditions including: 
 * extreme cold 
 * extreme wind 
 * heavy rain 
 * sleet 
 * hail 
 * snow 
 * extreme heat. 
 
It is essential to be aware of weather risks before heading out on your camp. To mitigate some of the weather risks, Youth members can bring along clothing such as: 
 * gore-tex/waterproof rain jackets and wind breakers 
 * rain pants 
 * hiking boots 
 * gaiters 
 * snowshoes 
 * beanie 
 * breathable layers 
 * smartwool socks 
 * moisture wicking clothes  
 
Requirements will change, depending on the predicted weather and area of camping.

- extreme cold
- extreme wind
- heavy rain
- sleet
- hail
- snow
- extreme heat.
- gore-tex/waterproof rain jackets and wind breakers
- rain pants
- hiking boots
- gaiters
- snowshoes
- beanie
- breathable layers
- smartwool socks
- moisture wicking clothes


### I can work with others to prepare a menu and food list for a weekend camp.

The youth member should consider 3 key areas that the menu will need to take into consideration: 
 * Ease of preparation at a camp site situation (depending on size of group and equipment available) 
 * Adequate stomach filling ability (what are ratios appropriate for the size of group and size of people you are catering for) 
 * The health qualities of the menu (will the people consuming the food have their dietary needs meet and will there be an adequate balance of fresh and dried foods).

- The health qualities of the menu (will the people consuming the food have their dietary needs meet and will there be an adequate balance of fresh and dried foods).


### I know about proper hygiene practices at camp and can discuss these with a Stage 2 Scout.

The youth member should be able to discuss and list the different ways to maintain personal hygiene. This includes using hand sanitiser when necessary, showering when available (or using baby wipes/similar cleaning products), ensuring hands are clean and sanitised when dealing with food preparation, using roll-on deodorant if appropriate (spray deodorant can effect people that have asthma and is a fire risk inside a tent), changing into clean and dry socks and underwear each day, and also making sure that all dishes are cleaned and dried appropriately.


### I can plan an activity for a camp that I will go on at this Stage.

The activity should fit the theme/agenda for the camp, and be fun, challenging, adventurous and inclusive. Ideally it will be active and exciting for all youth members.


### I can read an itinerary for a proposed camp and understand what I am required to do.

The youth member should be able to plan for a camp including personal gear, group gear, their travel details and anything else they need to plan to for a camp itinerary given to them. There should be minimal adult support during this requirement so the youth member can demonstrate their learning. This involves skills they have learnt in Stages 1 to 4.


## Do>

### I am familiar with the signs and symptoms of hypothermia and hyperthermia.

The youth member does not need to be aware of every sign and symptom but should be aware of the general and most common indicators: 
 
Hypothermia: 
 * Shivering 
 * Lack of coordination 
 * Slurred speech 
 * Loss of dexterity. 
 
Hyperthermia: 
 * Reddened skin 
 * Excess sweating 
 * Dizziness 
 * Vomiting or nausea 
 * Very high body/skin temperature(s).

- Shivering
- Lack of coordination
- Slurred speech
- Loss of dexterity.
- Reddened skin
- Excess sweating
- Dizziness
- Vomiting or nausea
- Very high body/skin temperature(s).


### I can implement safe sanitary practices at camp to avoid illness and environmental impacts.

Ensure that all Scouts follow the principles of 'leave no trace' and are committed to leaving the campsite better than it was found. Perform an emu-bob at the end of the camp with all members, and also make sure that there are adequate rubbish bins/one main bin area that everyone knows to place rubbish and recyclables into.


### I have assisted in pitching a patrol tent, troop tent or similar large tent at camp.

The youth member should help pitch a Patrol tent, Unit tent or similar. The Patrol combined should be able to pitch the tent with limited support from other members of the Unit.


### I have participated in five nights of camping at this stage, three of which are consecutive.

The consecutive camp could be a State, Region, District, Group, Unit, or Patrol camp, as long as it involves three consecutive nights of camping 'under canvas'.


### I can demonstrate and assist Stage 2 Scouts in setting up a tent.

The youth member needs to support others to set up a tent. The tent must be appropriately set up, with guy-ropes out stretched and pegs firmly in the designated peg points. The tent should be able to resist rain. Make sure that the poles are placed correctly and are equally sharing the weight/stretch of the fly and body. The role of the Stage 4 Scout is to support the Stage 2 Scouts with the set up of the tent, rather than leading the set up themselves.


### I can help organise campsite set up and pack down.

The youth member should assist with  set up  involving: 
 * Putting camp structures such as dining-flies up in appropriate locations 
 * Picking a fire location if applicable 
 * Tenting sites 
 * Food storage. 
 
For pack up, this could involve: 
 * Clearing a campsite of any rubbish 
 * Ensuring that it is impossible to tell that there were people there (return the site to its natural state if possible) 
 * Ensure that any campfires have been thoroughly and appropriately extinguished 
 * All of the tents, shelters, equipment and gear have been packed up tightly without water or dirt inside them.

### I can cook a meal at a camp without assistance.

The youth member could cook this meal on a campfire, or a camp burner such as a gas stove or spirits burner. The meal should be at least one course, and be a main meal of the day (breakast, lunch, or dinner) and should be enough food to feed the people attending the camp.


### I can safely light and extinguish a campfire.

The youth member needs to demonstrate lighting a campfire preferably at camp. This includes collecting kindling and wood, building and lighting the fire in a safe and controlled manner without the use of accelerants. 
 
The youth member then needs to demonstrate the best way to extinguish a campfire. This could include gently crushing the remaining coals/bits of flammable material with a shovel, then slowly pouring water on the fire, and stirring with the shovel. Slowly pour multiple loads of water onto the fire until all steam, smoke and bubbles stop. Bury the mud/ash/cold coal mixture safely.


### I can demonstrate the correct care and maintenance of group gear during and between camps.

The youth member should be involved in general maintenance and storage requirements of Group gear, supporting keeping a gear registry up to date and keeping gear in a good working order during camp.


### I know how to dry and store a tent.

The youth member has experienced packing up tents after a camp and then re-opening them for cleaning and drying, checking the working order while the tent is drying e.g. looking for holes or damage etc.


### I can demonstrate techniques to avoid injury when setting up, packing up or moving equipment.

The youth member needs to demonstrate best practise techniques with lifting, moving and setting up gear including but not limited to: 
 * Watching out for other people 
 * Lifting correctly 
 * Protecting themselves from jamming or squashing finger/toes or other parts of their body.

- Watching out for other people
- Lifting correctly
- Protecting themselves from jamming or squashing finger/toes or other parts of their body.


## Review>

### I can identify improvements that could be made for future camping trips I participated in or lead.

The youth member should reflect on their experiences at camp during Stage 4 and think about ways in which they can improve during Stage 5 and across the other core elements of Outdoor Adventure Skills. This could be identifying what skills they want to improve on or gain a basic knowledge of.


### I have checked equipment for damage and discussed if it needs to be repaired or replaced.

The youth member should check personal and/or group equipment for wear and tear, and then outline what needs to be fixed, monitored or replaced. This could also be applied to any gear taken on camp including activity specific gear.
