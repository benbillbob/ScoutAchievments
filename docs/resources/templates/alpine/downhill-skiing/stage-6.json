Their trip should be at least two days and one night, taking into consideration their Patrols experience and skill levels. \n \nRemember that one element of the Scout Method is Patrol system, so the youth member doesn't need to do everything themself. Working in a small team will help them enjoy their planning and with the Patrol's input into the plan, it will be a fantastic ski trip. \n \nThe youth member will need to have their plan reviewed and approved by a skilled downhill skier. This may be a youth member who has completed Stage 8 or an adult. Their ski trip may include overnight camping, or may be 'resort-based' and equate to a weekend away at the snow in 'chalet' accommodation, skiing each day."
