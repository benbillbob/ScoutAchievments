# Stage 6 - Alpine / Downhill Skiing

## Plan>

### I can plan a downhill skiing trip, including equipment, food, transportation, emergency risk matrix and action plan, slopes we want to cover and navigation.

The youth member should plan a downhill skiing trip, including routes, transport and risk management for the trip. Their trip should be at least two days and one night, taking into consideration their Patrols experience and skill levels. 
 
Remember that one element of the Scout Method is Patrol system, so the youth member doesn't need to do everything themself. Working in a small team will help them enjoy their planning and with the Patrol's input into the plan, it will be a fantastic ski trip. 
 
The youth member will need to have their plan reviewed and approved by a skilled downhill skier. This may be a youth member who has completed Stage 8 or an adult. Their ski trip may include overnight camping, or may be 'resort-based' and equate to a weekend away at the snow in 'chalet' accommodation, skiing each day.


### I have developed a detailed risk management plan for a trip that I am planning.

The youth member should include a detailed risk management plan for the trip they are planning. They are already able to identify possible hazards and how to minimise these risks based on their skills in Stage 5. 
 
Based on their further experience and knowledge in downhill skiing, the youth member should enhance their risk management plan. They should also ensure that emergency evacuation routes are present in their plan.


### I can teach a Stage 4 or below Scout how to care for, store and maintain skiing equipment.

At this stage the youth member should know how to care for, store and maintain their downhill skiing equipment and they should be able to pass that knowledge on to others. 
 
They should know they are successful in their teaching if the Stage 4 Scout is able to demonstrate this knowledge.


### I know the legislation and policies for safe conduct of a weekend downhill ski tour (e.g. AA standards, legal requirements, etc.).

The youth member should review and be able to discuss legislation and policies around safe conduct of an all-day ski tour, including the Alpine Code, and environmental considerations. They will need to consider their location and local policies and procedures, as well as the Australian Adventurous Activities Standards.


### I understand the dangers associated with ice during skiing.

The youth member should demonstrate their knowledge by discussing the dangers around ice during skiing to their two-up peer, or to the activity leader if there is no Stage 8 or higher peer.


## Do>

### I have participated in an alpine emergency response for a simulated casualty.

The youth member should participate in a mock emergency, relating to downhill skiing, in alpine conditions. This mock emergency should be run and managed by a Stage 8 peer, another suitably skilled downhill skier or alpine emergency expert.


### I can execute downhill alpine skiing techniques in parallel turns on intermediate terrain (blue runs), demonstrating efficient and co-ordinated movement.

The youth member should demonstrate their improved skills to their two-up peer or other skilled skier. This could be done in person, or a video could be taken for later review. They should log their activities, noting the runs they navigated, skills they are practicing and techniques they are able to consistently execute.


### I can make short, medium and long radius turns on intermediate terrain.

The youth member should demonstrate their improved skills to their two-up peer or other skilled skier. They should log their activities, noting the skills they are practicing and techniques they are able to consistently execute.


### I can demonstrate efficient and coordinated movement on small bumps whilst maintaining speed.

The youth member should demonstrate their improved skills to their two-up peer or other skilled skier. They should log their activities, noting the skills they are practicing and techniques they are able to consistently execute.


### I have attempted a small trick or jump in the terrain park at this stage.

The youth member should demonstrate their improved skills to their two-up peer or other skilled skier. They should log their activities, noting the skills they are practicing and the location of the terrain park. They should also make a note of other interesting details about their tricks. The youth member may also choose to work with a Patrol of friends to build a small jump or trick and then practice their jump or tick to support achievement of this statement.


### I can perform linked parallel OR telemark turns through the fall line on basic to intermediate terrain.

The youth member should demonstrate their improved skills to their two-up peer or other skilled skier. They should log their activities, noting the skills they are practicing and techniques they are able to consistently execute.


### I can apply speed control using sharp turns on all beginner and intermediate runs.

The youth member should be able to demonstrate their improved skills to their two-up peer or other skilled skier. They should log their activities, noting the skills they are practicing and techniques they are able to consistently execute.


### I have continued to further develop my downhill skiing skills through a minimum of 10 days skiing by the end of this stage.

The youth member should take part in at least ten (10) days of downhill skiing by the end of this stage. They should log their activities and include the skills demonstrated, when they did the activities, where they did their skiing, who they were with and what they learned during the trips. If their two-up peer mentor is not with them, they may choose to take photos and videos to support their log book entries.


### I have taught a Stage 4 Scout or below the basics of downhill skiing skills.

The youth member should be able to effectively pass on their knowledge of downhill skiing to assist another Scout working on a lower stage. They will know if they are successful in their teachings if that Scout is able to demonstrate those skills and understands the safety element and knowledge they have been taught. This could include fitting their skis, getting on and off chair lifts, moving/turning on their skis for the first time, snowploughing, etc.


## Review>

### I have written logbook entries for all of the skiing activities I have completed at this stage.

The youth member should log their activities and include: 
 * The skills demonstrated 
 * Location of the activities 
 * Who they were with 
 * What the weather was like and 
 * Anything else that stands out for that activity. 
 
They may also choose to include photographs in their log.

- The skills demonstrated
- Location of the activities
- Who they were with
- What the weather was like and
- Anything else that stands out for that activity.


### I have given a presentation to a group of Scouts at Stage 4 or below on a ski tour I've completed.

The youth member's presentation should be approximately three (3) minutes long, and may be in person or as a pre-recorded video followed by questions. The content of the reflection is at their discretion, with the purpose of the presentation being to encourage other Scouts to be excited by, or pursue, downhill skiing.


### I have identified areas for improvement in my downhill skiing skills and planned what I will do to improve them.

The youth member should reflect on their experiences and skills gained working through Stage 6, trying to identify where they feel they have improved their downhill skiing skills and what skills they need to keep working on. They should determine what their next steps are and set some goals to improve in areas they feel they need to improve.
