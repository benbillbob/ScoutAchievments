# Stage 4 - Alpine / Cross Country Skiing

## Plan>

### I can list conditions that may make skiing more hazardous or difficult.

The youth member should be considering the hazards that they could come across which might make skiing more difficult. They need to think about the environment, the equipment and the people with and around them.


### I know how to obtain and keep a supply of safe drinking water in the alpine environment.

The youth member should be planning their water prior to going on an activity, how much water they will need and where the local sources are. If the youth member chooses to melt snow, they need to make sure they have a billy and stove to ensure it gets to a rolling boil before drinking it.


### I know how to identify food and water requirements for day trips, including the increased needs arising from a day's cross country skiing.

The youth member should be able to: 
 * specify how much water to carry, and how often they will need to refill 
 * specify how many of each meal they will need (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks) and for how many people 
 * identify suitable foods for their cross country ski trip with regard to energy content, durability, perishability and deliciousness 
 * estimate overall energy requirements: how strenuous is the day? Will it make you eat more?

- identify suitable foods for their cross country ski trip with regard to energy content, durability, perishability and deliciousness
- estimate overall energy requirements: how strenuous is the day? Will it make you eat more?


### I can read a planned group itinerary for a proposed skiing trip and take responsibility for bringing or organising some of the equipment.

The youth member will need to demonstrate an understanding of a skiing trip from the itinerary. They will need to discuss the gear list, menu and route with the trip leader and bring what is required of them to the activity.


### I can identify various alpine signs and their meanings for skiers.

The youth member should be able to identify and discuss the different warning and information signs in the area they will be doing their activities, and what those mean for skiers. These should be out of resort or cross country related, unless needing to cross downhill areas in their trip.


## Do>

### I have taught a Stage 2 Scout or below how to dress for the alpine environment.

The youth member should be assisting a Stage 1 or 2 Scout to understand the layering principle when it comes to activities in the snow. They should assist them to understand what clothing may be appropriate for their alpine activities they are about to do.


### I can fit and adjust my own skiing equipment.

The youth member should demonstrate that they are able to adjust their skiing equipment so it is correctly fitted and comfortable. A Scout who is at Stage 6 in this area should assist them if possible, otherwise an adult/activity leader or other adult could also assist.


### I can participate in a ski tour while carrying a day pack that I have packed myself with the gear I require.

The youth member should take part and log a cross country ski tour, taking into account all of their planning. They should include what their involvement was in their log, and write where they did ski tour, who else was part of it and what they learned. This could be a 1 or 2 day trip at this Stage.


### I can demonstrate snow-ploughing, herringboning, sidestepping while on cross-country skis.

The youth member should be able to demonstrate these techniques to their two-up peer or the activity leader, and then log them in their book. Photos of them doing these skills are a great reminder of the experience and learning.


### I can safely fall over when unable to stop.

The youth member needs to learn the best way to fall safely so they minimise the risk of injury to themselves. They should be able to demonstrate safely falling over and provide evidence to their two-up peer. This could be demonstrated through drills and mock situations if required.


### I can demonstrate a safe approach to hazards and minimise risks to myself and the group, where possible.

The youth member should be able to demonstrate understanding of hazards and what to do to minimise the risk of them and how to safely approach them to avoid injury. Examples of some hazards include: 
 * snow drifts, 
 * ice, and 
 * rock shelves. The youth member may, with their trip leader and Project Patrol, discuss risk assessment and mitigation for their cross-country skiing trip.

- snow drifts,
- ice, and
- rock shelves. The youth member may, with their trip leader and Project Patrol, discuss risk assessment and mitigation for their cross-country skiing trip.


### I have taken part in two days of cross-country ski touring at this Stage.

The youth member should take part in two days of cross-country skiing and log these in their logbook. They should include details about when they did the activity, where they did the activities, who they did them with and what they learned during the trips.


## Review>

### I can identify where I have begun to improve my cross-country skiing skills, and where I would like to further improve.

The youth member should reflect on their activities undertaken in this stage. They should be able to identify where they feel they have improved in their cross-country skills and what they still need to work on. They should be encouraged to discuss this with their Patrol or Unit who can help them with the review.


### I have checked equipment for damage and discussed if it needs to be repaired or replaced.

The youth member should demonstrate a gear inspection after their activity. This can be a visual inspection. The youth member should be able to identify if there are rips, holes or cracks in equipment or gear and if anything needs replacing. This should be discussed with the leader or youth member in charge of equipment.


## Verify

### My logbook is up to date at the end of this stage.
