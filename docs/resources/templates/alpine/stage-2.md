# Stage 2 - Alpine

## Plan>

### I can explain what impact I can have on local vegetation when snow hiking or tobogganing over exposed shrubs.

The youth member should demonstrate understanding by discussing how their activity could impact the environment. They should think about the effect on plants, animals and erosion.


### I can discuss the appropriate action I should take in the case of an accident.

The youth member should be able to discuss first steps in an emergency response, following DRSABCD - Danger, Response, Send for help, Airway, Breathing, CPR, Defibrillation. 
The youth member should be able to nominate types of accidents that would only need themselves or an adult to manage, in contrast to requiring external services such as ski patrol or the emergency services.


### I can discuss what safety precautions you should take before going out in the snow.

The youth member should understand and discuss the safety precautions of the activity. They should know that the safety precautions should not restrict the enjoyment or purpose of the activity but are about minimising as much risk as possible. 
 
The youth member should consider contacting the authorities or governing body of the area they will be in, informing others, and thinking about other small accidents that may happen. They should know to: 
 * Make sure they have planned their activity 
 * Think about what could go wrong - is there anything they can do to prevent that from happening (risk assessment and mitigation)? 
 * Make sure they have a plan for if something does go wrong. They should make sure they have told someone else what the plan is.

- Make sure they have planned their activity
- Think about what could go wrong - is there anything they can do to prevent that from happening (risk assessment and mitigation)?
- Make sure they have a plan for if something does go wrong. They should make sure they have told someone else what the plan is.


### I can label a picture describing all of the essential equipment to bring to the snow.

The youth member could draw a picture or label a photograph of someone (or other image) who has all the essential equipment for a snow trip. The image should include all the relevant gear for the snow trips that the youth member is planning (e.g. a ski trip should have different gear to a snow camping trip).


## Do>

### I have walked for 1 kilometre in the snow.

The youth member should make sure this is a planned activity and then write the details in their logbook. Photos or videos should be uploaded to the logbook so they can be used for the review at the end of the Stage. The walk could be in resort grounds, in off-season on the higher ranges, or other negotiated options - it does not need to be a backcountry experience.


### I can protect myself when exposed to the elements associated with snow while outdoors.

The youth member should be able to demonstrate the wearing of suitable clothing for the activity and location, including slip, slop, slap, seek and slide. They should show an understanding that they can still get sun-burned even if it is cold outside. The youth member should be able to demonstrate that they are also prepared for cold and wet conditions with appropriate clothing and inner/outer layers.


### Before I start my snow activity, I can show where and when I am allowed to go.

They youth member should have a discussion with the activity leader or Patrol leader, pointing out on a map where they are allowed to go and where they are not allowed to go. <line break> The youth member should be able to point out landmarks on the boundaries to indicate that they understand the area they are allowed to be within.


### I have tried two different snow activities at this stage.

The youth member should have tried two different snow activities which could include tobogganing, hiking, skiing, snowboarding or other snow-based activities. These activities should be uploaded into their logbook with photos/videos included if possible.


### When I come inside, I can put away my outdoor clothing so they will dry quickly.

The youth member should demonstrate good etiquette when coming in from the snow, making sure they hang their gear correctly so that it dries. They should demonstrate an understanding of why we don't walk muddy or wet boots around the accommodation.


## Review>

### I have talked about what I enjoyed, learned or improved upon from at least two snow activities.

The youth member should review the two snow activities and discuss: 
 * Why did they enjoy those activities? 
 * Why were those activities fun? 
 * What did they learn from those activities whilst having fun? 
 * How can they apply what they have learned in the future?

- Why did they enjoy those activities?
- Why were those activities fun?
- What did they learn from those activities whilst having fun?
- How can they apply what they have learned in the future?


### I can suggest what could be done differently on a future snow hike or activity, to enjoy it more, to be safer, or to learn new things.

The youth member should take part in a reflection activity to determine what could be done better, what would make the activity more fun next time and if there were any learnings from the activity. These things may have been in the Plan> or Do> phases of the activity. They should think about: 
 * Did the leaders plan the whole activity/camp? 
 * Did the Scouts who attended get the opportunity to suggest how the weekend would be structured or what activities would be done? 
 
The youth member should think about how they developed through the SPICES throughout their chosen snow activities - it is ok if they feel like they haven't developed in each area throughout these activities.S

- Did the leaders plan the whole activity/camp?
- Did the Scouts who attended get the opportunity to suggest how the weekend would be structured or what activities would be done?
