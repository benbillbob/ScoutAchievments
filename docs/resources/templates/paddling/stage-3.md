# Stage 3 - Paddling

## Plan>

### I know what the risks are for paddling in different weather conditions.

The youth member should be able to explain risks associated with rain, electrical storms, high winds, and hot days. These risks should cover people, equipment and environment.


### I can explain the importance of wearing the right clothing and gear while paddling.

The youth member should be able to explain why it’s important to wear the correct clothing and gear for paddling activities and what that gear is. They will also need to consider dressing for the weather and any safety gear required.


### I know which items I should carry with me when paddling.

The youth member should be able to explain which items they would take with them based on their paddling activity. They will need to consider factors such as the location, duration, season and weather conditions, who is going and the availability of fresh water when deciding on what to bring.


### I know how and where to get the latest weather forecast for the area I will be paddling in.

The youth member should demonstrate this by researching weather forecast options and showing a copy of an up to date weather forecast for the area of their activity. They should be able to explain what the forecast they have brought means. This could be from the Bureau of Meteorology or a local weather station.


### I have learnt an additional stroke to assist with my paddling.

The youth member is required to learn about another paddling stroke, which is different to the ones learned in Stage 1 and 2, based on their watercraft. Strokes they could learn include: J-stroke, stop, sweep stroke, bow rudder, pry, low brace, high brace or draw.


### I can identify two different types of rescue techniques for a boat that has capsized.

The youth member needs to discuss two different rescue techniques for their watercraft and the steps involved if they need to do them. Options for rescue techniques could include T rescue, H rescue or self-rescue.


### I know different forms of communication to use between paddlers while on the water.

The youth member is required to demonstrate an understanding of different communication methods that can be used on the water. These can include either paddle signals or whistle calls and these calls should be in-line with the National Paddle Signals.


### I can identify common waterways markers.

The youth member should be able to demonstrate understanding of what the red, green and yellow marker buoys and the shapes of signs on waterways mean.


## Do>

### I know what DRSABCD stands for and how to using it in first aid situations.

The youth member needs to be able to explain to their Patrol or their two-up peer what their understanding of DRSABCD is and how to use it in a first aid situation. This should also be demonstrated in a mock emergency:  
 
D for Danger  
 
R for Response 
 
S for Send for Help 
 
A for Airway 
 
B for Breathing 
 
C for CPR 
 
D for Defibrillation.


### I can get in and out of my watercraft safely.

The youth member needs to demonstrate during a paddling activity how to safely enter and exit their watercraft. They could do this by doing the following: 
 * Face towards the bow, placing the paddle across the cockpit. 
 * Grasp the paddle gunwale (rail) on each side of the canoe. 
 * The bow person gets in first, while the other stabilises. 
 * To exit – do the reverse of getting in!

- Face towards the bow, placing the paddle across the cockpit.
- Grasp the paddle gunwale (rail) on each side of the canoe.
- The bow person gets in first, while the other stabilises.
- To exit – do the reverse of getting in!


###  I can secure my watercraft on the shore.

The youth member should demonstrate safely securing their watercraft to a shoreline or activity storage area using a knot they have learnt for paddling.


### I know how to choose a paddle that is the correct size.

The youth member is required to demonstrate selecting the correct size paddle and indicate why they chose that paddle. A canoe paddle should be from the ground to their armpit. A double blade kayak paddle ground to raised arm height.


### I have helped a Stage 1 paddler learn to put their PFD on.

The youth member should help a Scout working on Stage 1 to put their PFD on. They should ensure their straps are straight and firm and that the Scout is wearing the correct size and that the PFD can’t slip over their head.


### I have taken part in an at least two paddling activities at this Stage.

The youth member is required to have taken part in and log two (2) paddling activities of at least half a day each. These should be in addition to the activities done for Stage 2. Half a day is counted as 3 hours. They should include in their log where they did the activities, who they did it with and what they learned during the paddle.


### I can paddle my watercraft in the direction of travel, whether straight or around objects and shorelines.

The youth member is required to demonstrate using the correct strokes and paddle on both sides to avoid crashing into other craft and to navigate around objects.


### I have been a part of a raft up drill on the water and can explain its uses.

The youth member is required to demonstrate how to raft up with other watercraft. They should be able to discuss when and why they would need to raft up.


### I have capsized a canoe while sitting in it.

The youth member is required to safely capsize a canoe while sitting in it. They should roll forward to get out of the upturned craft and retrieve your paddle as soon as possible, ensuring you keep hold of the watercraft and signal for help.


### I can get back into my canoe or kayak with help from someone in another watercraft if my watercraft capsized.

The youth member is required to demonstrate getting back into their canoe or kayak with the help from someone. They could choose to use an H or X rescue or talk you through a self-rescue. These rescues should be logged in their logbook.


### I can swim 50 metres with my PFD on using any stroke.

The youth member is required to demonstrate swimming in their PFD for a distance of 25m, then tread water for 2 minutes and then swim the 25m back again.


### I can teach the importance of the buddy system to a less experienced Scout.

The youth member should teach a Scout working on Stage 1 or 2 the importance of the buddy system when undertaking paddling activities.


## Review>

### I have discussed with my Patrol what I have learnt about paddling safety from two paddling trips.

The youth member should review both of their paddling activities with their Patrol. This could include things that were forgotten, planning a different location for next time, reviewing teamwork with their buddy and group and damage to any equipment. Topics should also cover safety and how this can be improved for future activities.
