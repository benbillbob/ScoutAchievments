# Stage 9 - Paddling / Sea Kayaking

## Plan>

### I have kept my First Aid qualifications up to date.

The youth member should keep their CPR and First Aid qualifications current, by updating CPR annually and re-doing their first aid course every three years or as required for the wilderness skill set.


### I can develop a detailed risk management and mitigation plan for a paddling expedition involving hazardous conditions including paddling in waves and crossing current passages  for a period of four days or more.

The youth member should provide a detailed risk assessment and management plan as part of their sea kayaking activity plan and will need to account for: 
 * Human risk 
 * Environmental risk 
 * Equipment risk 
 
The youth member will also need to put in place mitigations for the risks identified and show action on these mitigations in the lead up and during their four (4) day trip.

- Human risk
- Environmental risk
- Equipment risk


### I can budget, prepare and manage every aspect of the expedition while acting as the party leader for a 4 day Sea Kayaking expedition.

The youth member should demonstrate effectively planning a 4 day sea kayaking expedition. The youth member's plans should include route plan, transport, budgets, risk management, equipment and contingency plans.


## Do>

### I have completed all necessary paperwork and planning for leading a trip, including float plan, emergency plan and additional local requirements.

The youth member should complete all the paperwork and permissions required in order to proceed with their 4 day sea kayaking trip planned above to complete below. Paperwork could be local state or territory National Parks/ landowners paperwork and/or Scouting Branch paperwork for the trip.


### I have demonstrated exiting my sea kayak after capsizing in wavy waters and can re-enter in a safe and controlled manner.

The youth member should be able to demonstrate an appropriate exiting technique from their sea kayak in moderate to difficult conditions and then show competent re-entry - they could use assistance from others or they could demonstrate solo with a roll.


### I have conducted kayak rolls in my sea kayak in conditions where I wouldn’t take a group of novices.

The youth member should be able to demonstrate an appropriate rolling technique in their sea kayak in moderate to difficult conditions. The youth member should remain calm and regain their paddling position quickly when they complete their roll.


### I have undertaken at least 30 days of paddling by the end of Stage 9.

The youth member needs to complete and log at least 30 days of sea kayaking by the end of this Stage. The youth member should include in their log when they did the activities, where they did the activities, who they did the activities with, and what the conditions were.


### I have assisted a Stage 7 Scout or below with the development of their sea kayaking skills.

The youth member should assist other Scouts working on Stage 7 Sea Kayaking. This includes providing constructive feedback and helping them learn the skills required to progress.


## Review>

### I have given a presentation to a group of scouts on the skills I have gained from completing the Paddling Outdoor Adventure Skills.

The youth member's presentation should be regarding an interesting, fun, challenging or unique aspect(s) about the skills they have gained. Because of the nature of the adventurous activity, it is recommended that a presentation is very visual, exciting and inspiring, rather than a dreary or boring PowerPoint/speech.


### I have considered what I would like to do with the level of skill I have gained through the Paddling Outdoor Adventure Skills, and discussed it with a trusted mentor.

The youth member should consider what they would like to do with the level of skill they have gained throughout the Outdoor Adventure Skills Stages of Paddling. The youth member should have a conversation with a mentor or friend to bounce ideas off. These could include a job in the industry, accrediting their youth program skills through Scouts Australia Institute of Training (SAIT), joining a paddling club or helping out with a Scouting activities team to support more youth through the Outdoor Adventure Skills. It's the youth member's personal journey.
