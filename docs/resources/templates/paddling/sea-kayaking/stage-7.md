# Stage 7 - Paddling / Sea Kayaking

## Plan>

### I can plan and lead a 2 night 3 day sea kayaking journey.

The youth member needs to plan and lead this journey with having remote supervision. All equipment, risk assessments, emergency action plans, route plan, menus etc. should be planned and carried with the group during the journey.


### With my team, I have developed a hazard assessment and risk control plan detailing how we will deal with injuries, illness, loss of equipment and other potential emergencies on our trip.

The youth member is required to develop a hazard assessment and risk control plan based on the increased risk of expedition based sea kayaking. Their plan should include what they should do to mitigate the risk of the hazards and if things don't go according to plan, how they will deal with injuries, loss of equipment and any other emergencies.


### I can plan navigation for my sea kayaking trips while considering local land, sea and weather conditions.

The youth member is required to draw up a navigational plan (float chart) using marine maps and consider local conditions. This will need to be done for their 2 night 3 day journey as well as any other sea kayaking at Stage 7.


### I know what items should be in an emergency kit for my sea kayaking trip.

The youth member should refer to the Australian Adventurous Activity standards which outline what equipment should be considered for sea kayaking trips. They should consider the type of activity, access to emergency services as well as skill of the group when planning this kit. They should include these items in the gear list for their sea kayaking trip. They should also ensure that they know how to use the equipment they carry.


### I understand and can plan for group dynamics in relation to Tuckman's stages of group development.

The youth member should be able to explain Tuckman's stages of group development, which are forming, storming, norming, performing and adjourning. They should also be able to discuss how group dynamics can affect performance and how knowing the group helps them to lead more effectively. They should use this knowledge to support planning group activities, food and equipment for their sea kayaking trip.


### I know and follow my local state or territory laws for the requirements for guided sea kayaking trips.

The youth member should review their Scouting Branch regulations as well as any local laws and the Australian Adventurous Activity Standards and Good Practice Guide.


## Do>

### I have participated in sailing my sea kayak.

The youth member is required to undertake, during good conditions and light to moderate winds, a sail in their sea kayak from one point to another. This can be done by constructing a sail with equipment they already have with the, like paddles, tent fly's etc. The youth members’ can join boats for this activity.


### I can show how and why the way I load my sea kayak will be different for different trips.

The youth member should demonstrate and be able to discuss how and why they load their sea kayak the way they do. They should take into consideration the water conditions, the manufacturers recommendation regarding weight capacity and storing of gear.


### I have undertaken at least 14 days of paddling by the end of Stage 7.

The youth member needs to complete and log at least 14 days of sea kayaking by the end of this Stage. In the log they should include; when they did the activities, where they did the activities, who they did the activities with and what the conditions were. Other notes such as stories and photos can also be included.


### I have paddled my sea kayak in a variety of weather and sea conditions.

The youth member is required to demonstrate paddling in sea conditions classified as easy up to moderate (swell/surf to 1m, wind 11kts). They should include this detail in your paddle log. Depending on the conditions they may need support and guidance from more experienced sea kayakers.


### I have identified threatening weather when on a sea kayaking trip and have taken appropriate action to protect myself and the group.

The youth member should be able to identify changing weather conditions that will be threating to the group while on activities and take appropriate actions to mitigate the risks to the group. If conditions during paddling in this stage don’t lend themselves to real life scenarios then this can be demonstrated through mock emergency drills of which a skilled kayaker can write to deliver on a days’ sea kayaking trip.


### I have successfully launched my sea kayak into small surf conditions.

The youth member needs to demonstrate launching their kayak from the beach in small surf conditions. This could be in swell up to 1m and waves up to half a meter.


### I have demonstrated using a hand pump to remove water from my sea kayak while on the water.

During a sea kayaking activity, the youth member will need to demonstrate using a hand pump to remove water from their kayak while keeping on track and stable in their craft. They could also support another boat to do the same task so they can see how hard or easy it is to use a pump across boats.


### I have demonstrated a kayak roll in a sea kayak.

The youth member is required to demonstrate an appropriate rolling technique in their sea kayak in up to moderate conditions. They should remain calm and regain their paddling position quickly when they complete their roll.


### I have led a 2 night, 3 day sea kayaking expedition.

The youth member needs to lead this journey with having remote supervision. All equipment, risk assessments, emergency action plans and route plan should be carried with the group during the journey.


## Review>

### I can provide feedback to a patrol of Scouts that I have led on a sea kayaking trip, on what we can improve on for the future, considering risk management, safety, location selection, level of difficulty, equipment management, etc.

The youth member should provide feedback to their Patrol on how the Patrol could improve white water kayaking expeditions in the future, considering risk management, safety, equipment management, location selection, level of difficulty and training.
