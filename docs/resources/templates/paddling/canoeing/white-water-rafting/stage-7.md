# Stage 7 - Paddling / Canoeing / White Water Rafting

## Plan>

### I can explain the relative benefits of various types of rafting materials and designs.

The youth member should research the benefits of different types of rafting materials and designs and then explain the relative benefits to their Unit, Patrol or a Scout doing an earlier Stage of paddling.


### I can explain why I should always wear an approved whitewater rafting helmet when I raft in rapids, and can demonstrate the correct use when whitewater kayaking.

The youth member should discuss the risks involved in white water rafting and the benefits of always wearing a paddling helmet when whitewater rafting. They should then demonstrate wearing one during their activities that is fitted correctly.


### I can pack for a whitewater rafting trip.

The youth member should include a packing list in their activity plan, taking into consideration the location and itinerary for the activity. They will need to consider how packing for a whitewater rafting trip differs from packing for a flat water canoe or kayak trip.


### I can assess risk and be aware of group safety.

The youth member is required to include a risk assessment and management plan in the planning of their activity. They should take into consideration their own safety as well as that of their Project Patrol.


### I have been part of a team to develop a hazard assessment and risk control plan detailing how we will deal with injuries, illness, loss of equipment and other potential emergencies on our trip.

The youth member is required to develop a hazard assessment and risk control plan based on the increased risk of whitewater rafting. Their plan should include what they should do to mitigate the risk of the hazards and if things don't go according to plan, how they will deal with injuries, loss of equipment and any other emergencies.


### I know the application of a throw bag in whitewater situations.

The youth member should know when and how to throw as well as how to restuff a throw bag in a whitewater situation. The youth member should practice throwing the bag on land so that when they need to use it, they are confident.


### I know what items of safety and rescue equipment I need for a whitewater rafting trip.

The youth member should refer to the Australian Adventurous Activity standards which outline what equipment should be considered for whitewater sports. They should include these items in the gear list they do for their whitewater rafting trip. They should also ensure that they know how to use the equipment they carry.


### I know what items should be in a first aid kit for remote location whitewater rafting.

The youth member is required to discuss what items they would put into a remote first aid kit taking into consideration the level of first aid training, size of the group, age of the participants and pre-existing medical conditions and how long it could be before they can get medical help.


### I understand the basic principles of a whitewater rescue (reach, throw, row, tow, go).

The youth member is required to display an understanding of the priorities of rescue. They should research white water rescue techniques and watch videos to get a sense of how to use proper technique in these situations.


### I know and follow my local state or territory laws for the requirements for guided whitewater trips.

The youth member should review their Scouting Branch regulations as well as any local laws and the Australian Adventurous Activity Standards and Good Practice Guide.


## Do>

### I know how to prepare a raft for safety and comfort.

The youth member should demonstrate setting up their whitewater raft for comfort and use before getting on the water. This could include back/seat placement, oar set, equipment placement and where the other paddlers will be in the boat etc.


### I can show how and why the way I load my raft will be different for different water conditions.

The youth member is required to demonstrate and discuss how and why they load their raft the way they do. They should take into consideration the water conditions, the manufacturers recommendation regarding weight capacity and storing of gear. They should consider if this loading will change in a whitewater raft compared to their flat water kayak or canoe.


### I can demonstrate 3 different whitewater raft skills with a team.

The youth member should demonstrate these skills to a skilled whitewater rafter and should be shown in grade 2 water.


### I can scout a rapid ahead and determine safe and unsafe paddle lines and communicate this to the rafting crew.

The youth member is required to demonstrate the ability to read the rapids ahead, practising picking out features such as eddies, strainers, holes and tounges and assist a more experienced paddler to give guidance to a paddle craft that is about to paddle a rapid.


### I can demonstrate defensive swimming to actively avoid hazards.

The youth member is required to demonstrate defensive swimming which conserves energy and helps them to actively avoid hazards.


### I can demonstrate rescuing and re-entering my raft in a whitewater situation.

The youth member is required to demonstrate self-rescue and re-entry into a raft in whitewater. Ideally the re-entry will be supported by all of the members that are in that raft roll. They should include this rescue practice in their logbook.


### I have participated in three days of whitewater rafting at this stage in Grade 2 water.

The youth member needs to complete and log at least 3 days of whitewater rafting by the end of this Stage. They should include this in their log as well as when they did the activities, where they did the activities, who they did the activities with and what grade of whitewater the activities were in.


### In the event of a capsize I have demonstrated staying upstream of the raft.

The youth member is required to demonstrate through mock emergency or real experience, capsizing the raft, staying upstream of the capsized raft and staying as safe as possible while in the water.


## Review>

### I can provide feedback to a patrol of Scouts that I have led on a rafting trip, on what we can improve on for the future, considering risk management, safety, location selection, level of difficulty, equipment management, etc.

The youth member should provide feedback to their Patrol on how the Patrol could improve whitewater rafting expeditions in the future, considering risk management, safety, equipment management, location selection, level of difficulty and training.


## Verify

### My logbook is up to date at the end of this stage.


### Upload supporting documents

_Each file should be less than 10MB in size._
