# Stage 1 - Cycling

## Plan>

### I have discussed what the purpose of a helmet is in a cycling environment.

The youth member should be able to explain that bicycle helmets, and good road/trail sense and awareness, are the most effective tools to reduce head injuries in the event of a crash or an accident while riding.


### I know how to wear and adjust a helmet.

The youth member should be able to demonstrate tightening the chin strap until it's snug allowing just two finger spaces between the chin and strap. 
 
They should also be able to talk about the importance of wearing the correct size helmet and fitting it correctly, covering the forehead and not rocking backwards and forward.


### I know the limits of where I may go each time I go out riding.

The youth member should discuss their limits and the boundaries of the cycling activity with Leaders/Patrol Leaders at the start of a journey, before they depart. Make sure that they build up to longer rides by taking shorter rides, so that the youth member knows their limits and personal ability. 
 
If working within a time restriction, the youth member could set a halfway time point at which they will turn around or line up with halfway on a loop. 
 
These limits might depend on personal ability, or they might depend on the area and safety in which the youth member will be riding within. 
 
Consider: 
 * How far are you allowed to go? 
 * How far are you capable of going? 
 * How far have you ridden before? 
 * What would  you do if you fall off or get hurt? 
 * How much water are you going to bring? 
 * Is the terrain hilly?

- How much water are you going to bring?
- Is the terrain hilly?


### I know why to stop when I get lost cycling.

The youth member should be able to talk about the benefits of stopping once they get lost. 
 
They should be able to explain that stopping makes it considerably easier for adults or other Scouts to be able to find them when they start searching for the lost Patrol.


### I understand that I should follow directions from a leader.

The youth member should ensure that they always stay alert as to what the Leader is directing. The Leader will likely be leading from in front, so the youth member should make sure there is open communication, and both parties can hear and see each other.


### I know why I should care for my bike and helmet after use.

The youth member should make sure their bike is cleaned and oiled/lubricated before they put it into a safe storage spot, this can be done with help from an adult. This will ensure it lasts for future use, requires less complex maintenance and repairs, and performs well over time. 
 
The youth member should always ensure there are no cracks or damage to their helmet to ensure maximum protection as they are crucial for safety. 
 
The youth member should be aware that over a longer ride, equipment might wear or rub on them, especially part of the helmet. This can be minimised by examining equipment prior to use, and taking care of equipment during and after use.


### I know the basic road rules relating to riding a bike.

The youth member should discuss with their Patrol the basic road rules which are to: 
 * Wear a helmet 
 * Go with the traffic flow 
 * Obey all traffic laws 
 * Yield to traffic when appropriate 
 * Be predictable 
 * Stay alert at all times 
 * Look before turning 
 * Watch for parked cars (doors may open)

- Watch for parked cars (doors may open)


## Do>

### I can show the main parts of a bike (ABC check).

The youth member should be able to do the ABC bike check. 
 * A is for air: Check the air pressure, spin the wheels and make sure the tires are not worn out. 
 * B is for brakes: Check to make sure brakes will stop the bike by spinning the back wheel and applying the brake. If the bike has hand brakes check to see that the levers don’t hit the handlebars when squeezed. Lift one tire up at a time and spin it; squeeze the levers to see if the tire stops. The brake pads should be clean, straight and contact the rims properly. 
 * C is for Cranks, Chain, and Cogs: Grab the crank arms and try to wiggle side to side. There should be no movement. Spin the pedals and cranks to see if the chain drives the rear wheel. The chain should look like metal not rust or black gunk. If the bike has gears check to make sure the gear levers and derailleurs (gear-changing mechanism) work to shift the chain between gears.

### I know about the Buddy system in relation to cycling.

An experienced youth member or adult leader will be the youth members' buddy and will teach them the key cycling rules and tips as they ride together or in a Patrol. Make sure that all members stick close together and follow their Leader, to help none of the members to get lost or injured.


### I have taken part in a short cycling trip.

The youth member should log the cycling trip in their logbook and write down who they did it with and anything interesting about the activity.


## Review>

### I can talk about what I enjoyed by participating in a bike ride.

The youth member should always review their adventures and should talk about their favourite thing from a bike ride with other Scouts or Leaders.


## Verify

### My logbook is up to date at the end of this stage.
