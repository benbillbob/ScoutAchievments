Arms should be in a relaxed with a slight bend at the elbow. Make sure that the youth member moves their hands around into new positions every so often. This is incredibly important if the ride is very long, as it prevents stiff, non-responsive hand movements \n * Neck position - It is important to not leave the head in the same tense position the whole time \n * The bend in the youth members' back - Cyclists should have an even and smooth arch in the back when sitting on the bike. \n * Hip and Torso Rotation - Ideally, they are pedalling with their legs and glutes.  Sometimes cyclists use torso muscles as well, and this is when improper posture sets in. \n * Standing up- Standing up gives a large power bonus at the expenditure of lots of energy and increased wind resistance. If using a suspension fork, they should not stand up when going uphill. It is almost always advisable to stand up while going downhill. The youth member should learn where the best balancing feet positions are."
