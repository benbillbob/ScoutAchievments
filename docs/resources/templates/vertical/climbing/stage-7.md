# Stage 7 - Vertical / Climbing

## Plan>

### I can plan and lead a two-day climbing weekend, including site selection, camp selection and group requirements, taking into consideration organisational policies and rules, with mentoring by a qualified person.

The youth member should plan and take primary leadership, which includes responsibility and risk management for the climbing trip. The youth member will need to take into consideration their State and local Government regulations and the Australian Adventurous Activity Standards. The youth member will need to have their plan reviewed and supervised by a highly skilled climber.


### I have completed Stage 5 and below of the 3 core Outdoor Adventure Skills.

The youth member will need to have completed Stage 5 and below of Bushcraft (survival skills), Camping and Bushwalking.


### I can pack for a day climbing trip which I would be the party leader for.

The youth member should know what is required to be packed for a climbing activity, taking into consideration the location and itinerary for the activity. They will also need to take into consideration items which will be needed for their party such as additional water, first aid items and specialised equipment for the activity.


### I have learnt two more knots that have application in a rescue situation, since Stage 5.

The youth member should already know how to tie an Alpine Butterfly, Figure of 8 re-threaded, Double Fisherman’s, Tape and a Prusik knot as well as the two additional knots they learned in Stage 5. The youth member need to ensure they still can tie these knots and choose an additional two knots to learn at this Stage. Options could be Munter hitch, French Prusik, Klemheist, or any other knots applicable to rescue situations whilst climbing.


### I have assisted a Stage 5 Scout with their requirements and needs for completion of Stage 5 Climbing.

The youth member will need to assist a Stage 5 Scout in climbing, including discussing with them where they are with their competencies for Stage 5 and assist them where they need help. This may see them acting as a Mentor for the youth member working towards Stage 5.


### I know if I need to engage with authorities before commencing a climbing activity.

The youth member should demonstrate awareness and understanding when they would need to engage with authorities before climbing, such as landowners, national parks, and based on Scouting policies notification of parents and Group Leaders etc. 


## Do>

### I have completed a single pitch mock lead climb.

The youth member should safely complete a single pitch mock lead climb. They should note it in their log and ensure a skilled climber is detailed as the verifier.


### I have completed 22 climbs by the completion of stage 7, 8 being at Grade 14 or above.

The youth member needs to complete and log at least 22 climbs by the end of this Stage, 8 being at grade 14 or higher. The youth member should include in their log when they did the climbing, where they did the activities, who they did them with, how high the climbs were and if they were graded how difficult.


### I have set up top-rope climbing top and bottom belays and I can determine the most appropriate belay systems according to participants' abilities and site conditions.

The youth member will need to demonstrate appropriate selection of which type of belay needs to be used and setting up that belay in accordance with the best set up for the site selection and participants skills. This may be done in a set of scenarios or through natural learning during activities.


### I can assist in the organisation of a climbing skills day which includes rescue techniques practise.

The youth member should assist a highly skilled climber in organising a climbing skills day including rescue practice. The youth member should note it in their log and ensure the skilled climber is detailed as the verifier.


### I have established a suitable communication system for participants to use while climbing and belaying.

The youth member should establish and demonstrate the communication calls between the climber and the belayer during the climbing activity. The youth member will need to consider the type of climb, height and what equipment they have access to.


### I can act as an appropriate supervisor of a climbing activity.

The youth member should demonstrate their ability to act as a supervisor during a climbing activity, ensuring that participants are following safety protocols and assisting and advising where necessary. The youth member will still need a highly skilled climber overseeing the activity.


### I have been involved in vertical rescue drills that include self-rescue and two rescues of others including raising, lowering and a mechanical advantage system.

The youth member needs to complete and log their climbing rescue drills indicating that they have undertaken these skills. The youth member should also include in their log where they did the activities, who they did them with and what skills they learnt.


### I have demonstrated to a Stage 5 Scout or below how to correctly pack up a rope and how to store this rope appropriately.

The youth member should demonstrate, to a Scout doing Stage 5, correct pack up and cleaning of any gear following the activity. The youth member will most likely need to teach the Stage 5 Scout how to appropriately coil the rope for carrying and storing.


### I can identify and communicate route features and hazards.

The youth member should be able to identify and then discuss their route, identifying features and potential hazards when climbing. If any changes need to be made to their proposed route whilst climbing review once they have finished the climb.


### I can interpret route descriptions.

The youth member needs to demonstrate that they can interpret multiple different climbing route descriptions according to guide books or local shared knowledge. They should be able to point out the key parts and features that are discussed within the guide.


### I can apply techniques to minimise the potential impact of a rock fall during an activity.

The youth member needs to consider the impact that rock fall may have on the Patrol or Unit if and when they occur and take steps to minimise the risks to the group in the planning and set up of the activity.


### I have practiced building anchors using traditional climbing gear (slings, cams, hexes, nuts).

The youth member needs to practice correct and timely setting of anchors using traditional climbing gear. This should be done under the supervision of a skilled climber and should be completed with a range of gear so as to develop a depth of knowledge.


## Review>

### I can provide feedback to my patrol of Scouts on how we could improve our climbing expeditions in the future, considering risk management, safety, equipment management, location selection, level of difficulty, training, etc.

The youth member will need to provide feedback to their Patrol that is suggested in the 'I' statement.
