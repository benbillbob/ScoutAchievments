# Stage 5 - Vertical / Climbing

## Plan>

### I know how to identify food and water requirements for day trips.

The youth member should be able to: 
 * Specify how much water to carry, and how often they will need to re-fill - if they are using creek water ensure it's filtered and purified 
 * Specify how many of each meal they will need (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks) and for how many people 
 * Identify suitable foods for the activity with regard to energy content, durability, perishability, and deliciousness 
 * Estimate overall energy requirements: How strenuous is the day?  Will it make the party eat more?

- Specify how much water to carry, and how often they will need to re-fill - if they are using creek water ensure it's filtered and purified
- Specify how many of each meal they will need (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks) and for how many people
- Identify suitable foods for the activity with regard to energy content, durability, perishability, and deliciousness
- Estimate overall energy requirements: How strenuous is the day?  Will it make the party eat more?


### I can select routes that minimise damage to the environment.

The youth member should demonstrate an understanding in their plan that they are able to select appropriate walking routes to the location and select locations where they are able to undertake the activity with minimal damage to the environment.


### I can identify possible hazards associated with climbing activities and procedures to minimise risks and I know how to take actions to minimise these risks.

The youth member should identify the difference between a hazard and a risk. They should provide a hazard assessment and will need to account for: 
 * Human hazards 
 * Environmental hazards 
 * Equipment hazards 
 
The youth member should include in their plan what steps they will take to minimise these hazards during an activity. They should then consider the risks that may come from these hazards and how they will mitigate these on an activity. This step could be done as a Patrol or individual before a climbing trip.

- Human hazards
- Environmental hazards
- Equipment hazards


### I know where to get information about climbing equipment selection.

The youth member should research and provide sources of information about selecting appropriate climbing equipment.


### I can put together a simple climbing trip itinerary.

The youth member should plan a simple climbing activity taking into consideration group skills, route options, logistical planning and risks associated.


### I can assist a Stage 3 or below Scout with their knotting skills

The youth member should assist a Scout working on Stage 3 or below with knots suitable for climbing.


### I can list six places to find information to assist with planning a climbing activity and what sort of information to look for.

The youth member will need to research and list 6 sources of information and the information required for planning their climbing activity.


## Do>

### I have successfully completed a Provide First Aid (including CPR) course from a recognised provider.

The youth member should complete a first aid course through an accredited provider. The first aid course should cover similar content to Provide First Aid (HLTAID011) or the current workplace first aid qualification. They could do a higher first aid unit, such as Provide Advanced First Aid or Provide First Aid in a remote location. 
 
*Members under the age of 14 may be able to participate in Provide First Aid courses, but may not necessarily receive the formal Units of Competency depending on provider.


### I can adjust and fit equipment to ensure personal comfort and safety.

The youth member should demonstrate competency in fitting and adjusting their climbing equipment.


### I can identify different natural features of a climb.

The youth member should identify different natural features while climbing such as slab, arete, off width crack, buttress, chimney, chock etc.


### I can use rest spots on a climb.

The youth member should demonstrate the ability to choose and use rest spots on a climb.


### I can abseil using a self-belay.

The youth member should demonstrate competency in safely self-belaying using a prusik hitch on an easy abseil.


### I always demonstrate appropriate techniques to minimise damage to the environment while climbing.

The youth member should demonstrate minimising damage to the environment whilst climbing. This includes walking to the climbing location and the use of correct tree protection for any top belaying and being careful to prevent erosion on and around the cliff.


### I have undertaken 10 climbs by the completion of Stage 5 Climbing.

The youth member needs to have attempted 10 climbs of grade 10 or higher, ideally they would have topped out on at least 5 of them. In their logbook entry the youth member should include where they did the activities, who they did them with, how high the route was, and the route difficulty (if graded).


### I have demonstrated climbing techniques to a Stage 3 or below Scout.

The youth member should assist a Scout working on Stage 3 or below by demonstrating suitable climbing techniques.


### I have assisted in setting up a top rope climb.

The youth member will need to set up using the appropriate knots, and ensure that a skilled person has checked the youth members set up before they test the line.


### I have assisted in setting up multiple types of belays for different climbs.

The youth member will need to set up using the appropriate knots, and ensure that an appointed Guide has checked the youth members set up before they test the line. The different types of belays could be top belay, bottom belay or self-belay.


### I have belayed at least 4 Scouts on different types of belays, including 2 top rope top belays and 2 top rope bottom belays.

The youth member needs to demonstrate using different belay devices, such as: 
 * Assisted braking devices 
 * Tubular device 
 * Inline belay devices 
 
The youth member will need to include the use of these belay devices in their logbook.

- Assisted braking devices
- Tubular device
- Inline belay devices


### I can safely escape a belay while keeping the climber safe.

The youth member will need to demonstrate escaping the belay whilst minimising any movement or increasing the risk of the climber falling.


### I have belayed two simulated climber falls.

The youth member will need to demonstrate safety for themselves and the climber stopping a fall from a climber during a mock situation.


### I know how to pack up a rope correctly.

The youth member should demonstrate coiling a climbing rope during a climbing activity, ensuring that it is clean and dry before packing away.


### I understand the concepts, principles, physics and consequences of shock loading in climbing.

The youth member should be able to explain and demonstrate understanding of shock loading in climbing.


### I have learnt two additional knots since Stage 4 that will assist me in climbing activities.

The youth member should already know how to tie: 
 * Alpine Butterfly 
 * Figure of 8 rethreaded 
 * Double Fisherman’s 
 * Tape knot 
 * Prusik knot. 
 
The youth member can choose an additional two knots to learn at this Stage, remembering dressing a knot is very important. Options could be: 
 * Munter hitch 
 * Rethreaded bowline with stopper 
 * Clove hitch

- Alpine Butterfly
- Figure of 8 rethreaded
- Double Fisherman’s
- Tape knot
- Prusik knot.
- Munter hitch
- Rethreaded bowline with stopper
- Clove hitch


## Review>

### I have given a presentation on a climbing expedition I have completed, to my Unit.

The presentation should be around five minutes long and may be in person or as a pre-recorded video followed by questions. 
 
The content of the reflection is at the youth member's discretion but should generally cover topics such as: 
 * What would they do again? 
 * What did not work, and would they not do again? 
 * What skills have they learnt? 
 * What food or equipment worked well, or performed poorly? 
 
Photographs are a great addition to a presentation.

- What would they do again?
- What did not work, and would they not do again?
- What skills have they learnt?
- What food or equipment worked well, or performed poorly?


### I have conducted an evaluation of relevant aspects of the climbing activity.

The youth member should conduct an evaluation on aspects they felt could have been improved on their climbing activity.


## Verify
