# Stage 9 - Vertical / Abseiling

## Plan>

### I have kept my First Aid qualifications up to date.

The youth member should keep their CPR and first aid qualifications current, by updating CPR annually and re-doing their wilderness first aid course every three years.


### I can plan multi-pitch abseil activities that cater to participants needs.

The youth member should demonstrate effective planning of multi-pitch abseiling activities which align with their participants needs. The youth member's plans should include transport, budgets, risk management, equipment and contingency plans as well as site selection and activity planning.


### I can develop a detailed risk management plan for a multi-pitch abseil.

The youth member should provide a detailed risk assessment and management plan as part of their multi-pitch activity plan and will need to account for: 
 * Human risk 
 * Environmental risk 
 * Equipment risk

- Human risk
- Environmental risk
- Equipment risk


## Do>

### I have undertaken over 50 abseiling descents on various surfaces and number of pitches.

The youth member needs to complete and log a minimum of 50 abseils by the end of this Stage. These should be on various surfaces and include multi-pitch descents. The youth member should include in their log when they did these activities, where they did these activities, who they did the activities with, how high the climbs/descents where & if they were graded how difficult.


### I can safely set up multi-pitch abseils including the use of double rope techniques and the retrieval of rope and other gear.

The youth member will need to demonstrate safely setting up a variety of multi-pitch abseils including rope and gear retrieval. The youth member should note the details in their log, and ensure they include a verifier's details. The youth member will need to demonstrate their knowledge of double rope techniques through this statement.


### I have demonstrated safe changeovers on multiple multi-pitch abseil trips.

The youth member will need to demonstrate safely changing ropes on a minimum 5 multi-pitch abseil trips. The youth member should note the details in their log, and ensure they include a verifier's details.


### I have demonstrated a range of vertical rescue techniques, which include techniques used in single and multi-pitch activities and when the participant is conscious and unconscious.

The youth member needs to demonstrate a range of vertical rescue drills and log them in their logbook. The youth member should include techniques used, when they did the drills, where they did the activities, who they did the activities with and any other information about the day, including who can verify the youth member's engagement and skill development.


### I have undertaken at least 20 days of abseiling by the end of Stage 9.

The youth member needs to do at least 20 abseiling activity days and log them in their logbook by the end of this Stage. The youth member should include where they did the activities, who they did the activities with, how high the ascents/descents were and if they were graded how difficult.


### I have assisted less experienced Scouts on at least two occasions through the abseiling requirements of Stage 7 and evaluated their learning.

The youth member should assist other Scouts working on Abseiling Stage 7, this includes providing constructive feedback and helping them learn the skills required to progress.


## Review>

### I have given a presentation to a group of Scouts on the skills I have gained from completing the Vertical Outdoor Adventure Skills in Abseiling.

The youth member's presentation may be in person or as a pre-recorded video, it could even be on a cliff or outdoors. 
 
The content of the reflection is at the youth member's discretion but should generally cover topics such as: 
 * What would they do again? 
 * What did not work, and would they not do again? 
 * What skills have they learnt? 
 * Photographs are a great addition to a presentation 
 
It should build on the youth member's passion for vertical adventures and inspire others to explore this Outdoor Adventure Skill area.

- What would they do again?
- What did not work, and would they not do again?
- What skills have they learnt?
- Photographs are a great addition to a presentation


### I have considered what I would like to do with the level of skill I have gained through the Vertical Outdoor Adventure Skills and have discussed it with a trusted mentor.

The youth member could consider using their log, evidence gathered and skills gained in achieving Stages 1-9 Abseiling Outdoor Adventure Skills towards a Recognition of Prior Learning process to be considered for the relevant VET Unit of Competency, to work in the industry, to join a Scouting adventurous activities team or a range of other options for them to continue enjoying vertical adventures.
