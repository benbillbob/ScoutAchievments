# Stage 2 - Boating

## Plan>

### I can select the correct PFD for me.

The youth member should be able to correctly select the right size PFD for themselves considering their height, weight etc.

The youth member should be able to correctly put on and adjust their PFD. They should make sure that they do up all the clips, buckles and zips on their PFD. They can demonstrate the correct fit by holding the shoulder straps and lifting, they shouldn’t go above their ears.


### I can discuss what safety precautions we should take before going out on the water.

The youth member should be able to discuss how to stay safe when going on the water. They should include things like weather and tides, and consider their location and who they are with too. Scouts working on Stage 4 can help them.

The youth member should be able to describe what clothes they should wear and why they feel that these are the correct clothes to wear during a boating activity. They will need to consider the weather, climate and type of watercraft they will be using.


### I can describe four appropriate actions I should take if I capsize a sailboat or rowboat.

### I can label a diagram describing all of the essential equipment required for boating activities.

The youth member diagram should include water, food, clothing, first aid kit, sun safe gear, PFD, any emergency gear they see important, watercraft and equipment required for their chosen watercraft.


### I can tie a knot that will help me on a boating trip.

### I can suggest what could be done differently on a future boating activity, to enjoy it more, to be safer, or to learn new things.
