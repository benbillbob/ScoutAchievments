# Stage 6 - Boating / Sailing

## Plan>

### I understand and have taken the appropriate actions to maintain hydration.

The youth member should be able to demonstrate understanding by including the details of how much water and electrolytes they will be providing for themselves and their crew in their float plan, and making their plan during an activity.


### I understand, and can explain, air dynamics on a sail.

The youth member should be able to explain air dynamics on a sail and how it applies when sailing.


### I can evaluate local sailing hazards and plan accordingly.

The youth member should be able to evaluate local sailing hazards using maritime maps, navigational charts and local knowledge of the area. Their risk assessment should include these hazards and mitigation strategies to reduce the possible risks.


### I can explain what a dead run is and the signs that it is occurring.

The youth member should be able to discuss what a dead run is, how they know when they are sailing on a dead run, and what to do when it does occur.


### I understand the use of a trapeze in the context of sailing.

The youth member should be able to discuss what trapezing is and when they would do it.


### I can give a safety briefing to a new crew before sailing.

The youth member should include the safety points in their float plan and then discuss these with a new crew to ensure that everyone understands what is required of them and what the mitigation strategies are to minimise the risks for their activity.


### I have looked through my float plan from Stage 5 and have adjusted it to lead later in this stage.

The youth member should review their previous float plan and update their float plan based on the different conditions, circumstances, location and the fact that they will be leading the sailing activity. They should also include anything that was raised in the review they had following their Stage 5 activity as well as including anything new that they have learned in their recent sailing experiences.


## Do>

### I can clearly communicate with my crew to trim the sails and balance the boat on all points of sailing.

The youth member should demonstrate clear communication with their crew during sailing to ensure that they trim the sails and balance the boat suitably. This can be documented through the review at the end of the activity, or they could have someone video their briefings and communication during sailing.


### I can clearly communicate with my crew to synchronise the helm to sail trim and to boat balance.

The youth member should demonstrate clear communication with their crew during sailing to ensure that they synchronise the helm to sail trim and keep the boat balanced. This can be documented through the review at the end of the activity, or they could have someone video their briefings and communication during sailing.


### I can inspect a rigged sailboat and identify faulty boat parts, repairing or replacing items as needed.

The youth member should demonstrate inspecting a rigged sailboat before participating in a sailing activity, describing what they are looking for and outlining what the common faults could be. This could be undertaken as a simulation activity on a boat which has some known faults with the youth member identifying and performing simple repair on these faults. Ensure they write up their activity in their logbook including what was faulty and repaired.


### I have participated in sailing a marked course or competitive sail day.

The youth member should participate in a marked course or competitive sailing day and log it in their logbook, including who their crew was, their role, the weather conditions and anything else that was interesting about the activity.


### I have used communication devices to communicate with a home party on land.

The youth member should detail which communication devices they will be using in their float plan and carry out a check-in with the person who is their contact on land, who also has a copy of their float plan. This could be via VHF/HF radio, mobile phone or a device such as Garmin InReach.


### I have sailed on a compass bearing.

The youth member should demonstrate successfully sailing on a compass bearing.


### I have participated in a simulated MOB exercise and I have learnt 2 methods to recover a person from the water.

The youth member should have already had some practice in Stage 5 demonstrating the correct procedures if someone falls overboard. They should be able to successfully follow their emergency action plan for a Man Overboard and recover them from the water using two different methods. They should log the rescue activity, noting what they did during the activity (Photos or video can be great evidence too).


### I have undertaken at least 8 days of sailing.

The youth member needs to do eight sailing activity days and ensure they are in their logbook. A day is counted as roughly 4-6 hours of activity time depending on conditions and skill of their crew at stage 6. In their log they should include when they did the activity, where they did the activities, who they did it with, the weather was like and any other interesting information about their activity.


### I have led a day sail with a small Patrol with the supervision of a Stage 8 Scout or above.

The youth member should use their float plan, discussed above, to lead a sailing day with a small Patrol. They should take into consideration all the planning and doing 'I-statements' they have achieved so far. This activity should be recorded in their logbook, including who their Stage 8 supervisor was.


### I can measure distances and plot a safe route on a chart, and determine the true bearing to steer.

The youth member should demonstrate measuring distance and plotting a safe route on a marine chart during their planning. They should demonstrate steering to a true bearing and following their navigation plan whilst sailing.


### I understand spinnaker setting and retrieval techniques.

The youth member should be able to discuss and then demonstrate setting up and using a spinnaker as well as retrieving it when dropped. The key to using a spinnaker is preparation and practice.


## Review>

### I have looked through my float plan from Stage 5 and have adjusted it, taking into account what I know from my recent sailing experiences.

The youth member should review their previous float plan and update their float plan based on the different conditions, circumstances, and location. They should also include anything that was raised in the review they had following their activity, as well as including anything new that they have learned in their recent experiences.


### I have given a presentation to a group of Scouts in Stage 4 or lower on a sailing activity I have completed.

The youth member's presentation should be around three to five minutes long, and may be in person or as a pre-recorded video followed by questions. 
 
The content of the reflection is at their discretion, and the purpose of the presentation is to encourage younger Scouts to become excited about sailing opportunities.


### I can demonstrate the correct maintenance of Scout Group, Scout Centre, borrowed, or my own sailing gear following the conclusion of a sailing activity.

The youth member should demonstrate correctly cleaning, storing and maintenance of gear after a sailing activity. If any equipment is damaged they should ensure it is reported to their Leader.
