  <div class="stage-section-body"><h3>I can teach a group or Patrol how to prepare for a caving expedition.</h3>
<p>The youth member should know what is required to prepare for a single caving expedition based on their ‘I-statements’ from Stages 1-7. The youth member should be able to effectively pass this knowledge on to another Scout, supporting them in their skill development and learning working on a lower stage.</p>
<p>If it has been a while since the youth member prepared for a caving expedition they should brush up on their skills and look back on their previous activity reviews.</p>
<p>It is expected that the activity would go for a full one or two days at this Stage.</p>
<h3>I can teach another youth how to plan a caving activity in unfamiliar territory using the appropriate tools.</h3>
<p>The youth member should know what is required to plan for a single pitch caving activity based on their ‘I-statements’ from Stages 1-7. The youth member should be able to effectively pass this knowledge on to another Scout, working on a lower stage to support them in their learning. This can be a couple of hour activity, skill development, rescue practice or supporting them to run a caving activity for a Patrol/ Unit of less experienced Scouts.</p>
<h3>I can plan for best practise minimal impact activities and can assist a Stage 6 Scout or lower on why site and activity specific minimal impact is important in caving activities.</h3>
<p>The youth member should know minimal impact best practice is and be able to assist a Scout working on Stage 6 or lower the importance when caving. The youth member should refer to the Scout Environmental Charter and be able to discuss the following with regards to Caving:</p>
<ul>
<li>Living sustainable lives by taking action to reduce negative impacts</li>
<li>Protecting and improving biodiversity</li>
<li>Learning about the environment and inspiring others</li>
<li>Enjoying and connecting</li>
<li>Thinking global, acting local</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h3>I can plan complex rigging for redirections and changeover of belays in a cave environment.</h3>
<p>The youth member should demonstrate effective planning to enable their Patrol to rig for redirections and changeover belays within a cave environment.</p>
<h3>I can plan a caving trip through a vertical cave including all necessary logistics, group requirements while adhering to organisation policies and procedures.</h3>
<p>The youth member needs to complete a vertical caving trip activity plan. This plan should be in addition to the two-day caving trip they planned for Stage 7.</p>

  <div class="stage-section-body"><h3>I have successfully completed the Wilderness First Aid skill set.</h3>
<p>The youth member must have completed the Wilderness First Aid skill set. This can be through a course with an accredited provider or by other means, such as Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) through SAIT or other providers. For the purposes of the Outdoor Adventure Skills, a Wilderness First Aid course consists of SIS training package’s Wilderness First Aid skillset (SISSS00126), or its replacement:</p>
<ul>
<li>HLTAID011 Provide first aid</li>
<li>SISOFLD004 Provide first aid in remote locations</li>
<li>SISXEMR002 Coordinate emergency responses.</li>

</ul>
<h3>I have been the party leader for a vertical caving journey.</h3>
<p>The youth member should follow the plan they undertook above and take primary leadership of this journey, which includes responsibility and risk management for the caving expedition. The youth member will need to take into consideration their Branch policies, state and local government regulations and the Australian Adventurous Activity Standards. The youth member will need to have their plan reviewed and indirectly supervised by a highly skilled caver.</p>
<h3>I have rigged ladders with appropriate belays in a caving environment.</h3>
<p>The youth member will need to demonstrate rigging ladders throughout different caves during Stage 8. This will include making sure the rigging is safe, that there are appropriate belays rigged and that the rigging is retrievable. This should be done a minimum of three times.</p>
<h3>I can negotiate hazards and obstacles safely and take measures to guard personal and group safety.</h3>
<p>The youth member should demonstrate identifying and determining alternative routes through the cave to avoid hazards and obstacles. This could be done in real caving trips or in mock situations.</p>
<h3>I have determined an appropriate caving activity plan according to participants’ needs and characteristics, and by following relevant legislation and organisational policies and procedures.</h3>
<p>The youth member should draft a plan in order to teach caving skills to Scouts. Their caving activity and teachings should be based on the group needs and the youth member should ensure they follow relevant legislation and organisational policies and procedures.</p>
<h3>I have completed the required paperwork to request to explore a restricted caving location.</h3>
<p>The youth member will need to contact landowners and complete relevant paperwork in order to gain permission to explore a restricted caving location. The youth member may by this stage be involved in a caving club and they could have members with contacts. This statement is about asking to enter though the appropriate channels, however if the access is denied the youth member will still meet the requirements for this statement.</p>
<h3>I have led vertical rescue drills, lasting half a day at least, demonstrating rescue skills that include self-rescue, lower, and a haul system rescue.</h3>
<p>The youth member needs to plan and lead these caving rescue drills, ideally with the help of a Scout working on Stage 7. The youth member should ensure they log their rescue drills indicating that they have undertaken these skills. The youth member should also include in their log where they did the caving activities, who they did them with, and who the skilled verifier was for this activity.</p>
<h3>I have developed contingency plans for caving activities using detailed weather and environmental information gathered from relevant sources.</h3>
<p>The youth member should demonstrate their ability to obtain and interpret detailed weather and environmental information which is relevant to the caving system and the location they are planning to run their activity or expedition. The youth member should also include contingency plans should the weather impact on their activity.</p>
<h3>I have received feedback and evaluated relevant aspects of caving sessions, and determined the level of learning achieved.</h3>
<p>The youth member should actively request feedback from the participants on caving activities to ascertain learnings by the participants. They should evaluate the aspects of the sessions with their participants as well as self-assess as to how the activities went and if they met the intended activity/session goals.</p>
<h3>I apply clear and accurate instructional techniques to impart activity specific knowledge, caving skills and safety and rescue procedures.</h3>
<p>The youth member needs to demonstrate their instructional techniques based on their activity plan they have developed. The youth member will know if they are successful in their teachings if the Scouts attending the caving activity understand what the youth member has told/ demonstrated to them and are able to demonstrate the caving skills, safety and rescue procedures that the youth member has taught them, and feedback on the sessions should be a good indicator of where the youth member can improve.</p>
<h3>I have participated in a multi-pitch cave activity.</h3>
<p>The youth member needs to complete and log a multi-pitch caving activity. The youth member should include in their log when they did these activities, where they did the activities, who they did them with, how deep or high the caves were, and, if they were graded, how difficult they were.</p>
<h3>I have participated in 15 days of caving by the end of Stage 8, four caves of which I have led.</h3>
<p>The youth member needs to complete and log 15 days of caving activities, with a minimum of 4 activities they should have planned and led. The youth member should include these in their log, when they did these activities, where they did the activities, who they did them with and, if they were graded, how difficult they were.</p>
