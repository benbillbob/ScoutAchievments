  <div class="stage-section-body"><h3>I can teach another youth what to pack for a canyon activity of my choice.</h3>
<p>The youth member should know what is required to be packed for a canyon activity, taking into consideration the location and itinerary for the activity. They should be able to effectively pass this knowledge on to another Scout, working on a lower stage. The youth member will need to consider how they are going to convey this information.</p>
<h3>I can help organize the transportation required for an activity.</h3>
<p>The youth member should ensure they take into consideration transportation for a canyoning activity they are planning. This will include getting the group and gear to the location and back to the finishing point. The youth member can do this I statement in conjunction with when they plan a canyoning trip in this Stage.</p>
<h3>I can discuss hazards of canyoning activities to Stage 4 Scouts or below.</h3>
<p>The youth member should consider hazards which they know are involved in canyoning activities. These could be:</p>
<ul>

<ul>
<li>Human risk</li>
<li>Environmental risk</li>
<li>Equipment risk</li>
</ul>
<h3>I can research the best gear for an activity application.</h3>
<p>The youth member should research and provide information about equipment selection for their canyoning activity, including the reasons for their choices. If they don’t have access to the gear they would like to use after their research, then the youth member should present to their Patrol why they would prefer to use other pieces of equipment rather than needing to purchase the new gear.</p>
<h3>I can research a variety of self-belay techniques and the best applications for them.</h3>
<p>The youth member should research and provide information about different self-belaying techniques and when they would use those techniques and why. The youth member could write down their research or speak to their Patrol/ Unit or Project Patrol about the research.</p>
<h3>I can research a variety of rescue techniques for canyoning activities.</h3>
<p>The youth member should research and provide information about a variety of rescue techniques and when they would use those techniques and why.</p>
<h3>I know why site and activity specific minimal impact is important in canyoning activities.</h3>
<p>The youth member should understand and demonstrate the importance of minimal impact when on a canyoning activity. The youth member may do some research before they go on a vertical activity which may include looking at the Australian Adventurous Activities Standards and Good Practice Guides.</p>
<h3>I can plan for best practice minimal impact activities.</h3>
<p>The youth member should demonstrate in their planning safe and minimal impact access to and from the canyon, indicating why they have chosen that route. They should also indicate the other minimal impact practices they will undertake whilst canyoning.</p>

  <div class="stage-section-body"><h3>I can negotiate obstacles and avoid or remove hazards to descend in a controlled manner in a canyon.</h3>
<p>The youth member should demonstrate navigating around obstacles in an efficient and safe manner. These should be noted in their logbook as evidence. They may also choose to take photos you negotiating hazards (as long as this is safe and depending on the hazard).</p>
<h3>I can care for and maintain equipment to ensure prolonged lifespan and safety requirements, as advised by the manufacturer’s recommendations for equipment use</h3>
<p>The youth member should demonstrate care for the canyoning equipment at all times before, during and after an activity. They should ensure that they inspect it prior, during and post activity and ensure that they are using it based on the manufacturer’s recommendations.</p>
<h3>I know how weather can impact canyoning activities and how to evacuate when necessary.</h3>
<p>The youth member should demonstrate knowledge of the weather impacts on canyoning and indicate in their plan how and where they will be evacuating should the need arise. The youth member may research canyoning accidents that have been a result of weather changes to help understand how the features in a canyon will affect their safety if weather changes.</p>
<h3>I have reviewed the weather system impacts discussed in Stage 4 and can facilitate a Stage 4 Scout in their learning.</h3>
<p>The youth member should review and discuss your evacuation plan with a Scout working on Stage 4 Canyoning, including discussions about the importance of checking the weather and the impact it can have on canyoning. They will need to support a Stage 4 Scout understanding the weather hazards associated with canyoning.</p>
<h3>I can complete all necessary equipment safety checks, and action unsafe equipment according to organisational policies and procedures.</h3>
<p>The youth member should demonstrate necessary equipment checks prior, during and following the activity. They should log the activity and usage in an equipment log and ensure they are following Branch or State policies as well as the adventurous activity standards.</p>
<h3>I have assisted a Stage 4 Scout in knowing the importance of safety checks, including ABCDE.</h3>
<p>The youth member should discuss with a Scout working on Stage 4 Canyoning on the importance of the ABCDE checks. The youth member will need to provide assistance in ensuring they are following the safety checks. The youth member will know if they are successful if that Scout follows those safety checks correctly during the activity.</p>
<p>Remember:</p>
<ul>
<li>A - Anchor(s)</li>
<li>B - Buckles</li>
<li>C - Carabiner(s)</li>
<li>D - Devices</li>
<li>E - Ends/Equipment/Edge/Everything else</li>
</ul>

<li>D - Devices</li>
<li>E - Ends/Equipment/Edge/Everything else</li>
</ul>
<h3>I always complete all necessary personal checks using the buddy system, prior to commencing canyoning and/or belaying and can assist a Stage 4 Scout or below in what these are.</h3>
<p>The youth member should always complete all the necessary personal checks before canyoning or belaying.</p>
<ul>
<li>A - Anchor(s)</li>
<li>B - Buckles</li>
<li>C - Carabiner(s)</li>
<li>D - Descender</li>
<li>E - Everything else e.g. gloves</li>
</ul>
<p>The youth member should also assist a Scout working on Stage 4 or below in understanding what these are.</p>
<ul>
<li>A - Anchor(s)</li>
<li>B - Buckles</li>
<li>C - Carabiner(s)</li>
<li>D - Descender</li>
<li>E - Everything else e.g. gloves</li>
</ul>
<h3>I have been involved in at least two different types of vertical rescue drills.</h3>
<p>The youth member needs to do two or more vertical rescue drills and log them in their logbook. The youth member should include where they did the activities, who they did them with and any other information about the day as well as who the skilled canyoner was. This could involve a transfer over knot, pluck and lower, mechanical haul practise, prusiking over an edge, etc.</p>
<h3>I have set up a minimum of three different types of abseils in a canyon from start to finish including locating appropriate anchors, setting hardware and rope, setting up a top belay if appropriate and doing final safety checks, before going over for the first descent, under the supervision of a skilled person.</h3>
<p>The youth member will need to demonstrate three full abseiling set-ups in canyons using the appropriate anchor selection, knots, degree of rope, caribiner placement and direction of pull and ensure that a skilled canyoner has checked your set-up before you test the lines. This should be indicated in your log and ensure your skilled canyoner has been noted as the verifier.</p>
<h3>I have established a belay from which the belayer is able to escape and maintain the safety of the participant.</h3>
<p>The youth member will need to demonstrate the set up of and escaping the belay whilst minimising any movement of the canyoner. They should oversee a Stage 4 or 5 Scout escaping from the belay while they keep the abseiler safe.</p>
<h3>I have assisted to manage people in a small space to minimise the risks of hypothermia.</h3>
<p>The youth member should assist in managing people during canyoning. They will need to demonstrate an understanding of the risks of hyperthermia, and drowning, particularly whilst canyoning.</p>
<h3>I have escaped from multiple belays while making sure the abseiler is still safe.</h3>
<p>The youth member will need to demonstrate at least 3 times escaping the belay whilst minimising any movement of the abseiler. They should indicate these skills in their log.</p>
<h3>I can demonstrate single-rope techniques for a variety of changeovers (e.g. passing a knot &amp; changing from ascending to descending &amp; vice versa).</h3>
<p>The youth member needs to learn and demonstrate these techniques under the guidance and supervision of a skilled abseiler.</p>
<h3>I have completed a minimum of twelve canyons, seven of which must be different canyons by the completion of Stage 6.</h3>
<p>The youth member needs to complete twelve (12) or more canyoning activity days and log them in their logbook. They should have explored at least seven (7) different canyons. They should include when they did these canyons, where they did the activities, who they did it with, how high they were, and if they were graded, how difficult they were. Photos and additional notes are a good addition to their log as well.</p>
