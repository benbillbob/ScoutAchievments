  <div class="stage-section-body"><h3>I have kept my First Aid qualifications up to date.</h3>
<p>The youth member should keep their CPR and first aid qualifications current, by updating CPR annually and re-doing their wilderness first aid course every three years.</p>
<h3>I can develop a detailed risk management plan for a canyoning weekend</h3>
<p>The youth member should provide a detailed risk assessment and management plan as part of their canyoning weekend plan and will need to account for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Human risk</li>
<li>Environmental risk</li>
<li>Equipment risk</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Human risk</li>
<li>Environmental risk</li>
<li>Equipment risk</li>
</ul>
<h3>I can budget, prepare and manage every aspect of a weekend canyoning trip.</h3>
<p>The youth member should demonstrate effective of planning a weekend canyoning trip. Their plans should include transport, budgets, risk management, equipment, canyoning routes and contingency plans.</p>

<section class="stage-section" data-testid="section-do">
  <button class="stage-section-toggle" type="button" aria-expanded="false">Do</button>
  <div class="stage-section-body"><h3>I have mapped out a canyoning system, taking into consideration both vertical and horizontal obstacles.</h3>
<p>The youth member should draw up a map of the canyoning system they are planning to navigate. They should indicate the vertical and horizontal obstacles, include entry, exit and evacuation routes, rough distances and heights of vertical drops or climbs involved.</p>
<h3>I have demonstrated a range of vertical rescue techniques, which include techniques used on single and multi-pitch activities and when the participant is conscious and unconscious.</h3>
<p>The youth member needs to demonstrate a range of vertical rescue drills and log them in their logbook. The youth member should include techniques used, when they did the drills, where they did the activities, who they did them with and any other information about the day, including who can verify their engagement and skill development.</p>
<h3>I can retrieve and manage ropes in a variety of canyon environments.</h3>
<p>The youth member will need to demonstrate rope retrieval and effectively managing their ropes within a canyon.</p>
<h3>I can demonstrate to a Stage 7 Scout or below drying and then storing equipment appropriately.</h3>
<p>The youth member should demonstrate, to a Scout doing Stage 7, correct drying and cleaning of any gear following the activity.</p>
<h3>I can assist less experienced Scouts through the canyoning requirements of Stage 7 and evaluate their learning.</h3>
<p>The youth member should assist other Scouts working on Stage 7 Canyoning. This includes providing constructive feedback and helping them learn the skills required to progress.</p>
<h3>I have assessed all anchors on multiple canyoning trips for safety and load purposes.</h3>
<p>The youth member should be managing their canyoning trips and therefore assessing all the anchors on their trips for safety and load purposes. The youth member should ensure that the Scout setting the anchors receives constructive feedback where necessary.</p>
<h3>I can rig multiple anchor points to equalise the load and minimise shock loading.</h3>
<p>The youth member should demonstrate rigging multiple anchor points to equalise load and to minimise shock loading. These set-ups need to be included in the youth member’s log. The youth member could always use photographs as evidence too. This can be done in a drill/ skills development day and doesn’t need to be learnt or shown in a canyon.</p>
<h3>I have led a minimum of 8 canyoning trips by the completion of Stage 9.</h3>
<p>The youth member needs to lead a minimum of 8 canyoning trips. The youth member should include in their log where they did the activities, who they did the trips with, and the complexity of the canyon system.</p>
<h3>I have logged a variety of canyoning trips by the end of Stage 9 including wet, dry, vertical and horizontal.</h3>
<p>The youth member will need to complete a variety of different types of canyoning trips including wet, dry, vertical and horizontal. A rough idea could be 35 canyons by the completion of Stage 9 with 5 of them being difficult canyons for Australian conditions.</p>

<section class="stage-section" data-testid="section-review">
  <button class="stage-section-toggle" type="button" aria-expanded="false">Review</button>
  <div class="stage-section-body"><h3>I have given a presentation to a group of Scouts on the skills I have gained from completing the Vertical Outdoor Adventure Skills in Canyoning.</h3>
<p>The youth member’s presentation may be in person or as a pre-recorded video, it could even be on a cliff or outdoors.</p>
<p>The content of the reflection is at the youth member’s discretion but should generally cover topics such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>What would they do again?</li>
<li>What did not work, and would they not do again?</li>
<li>What skills have they learnt?</li>
<li>Photographs are a great addition to a presentation</li>
</ul>
<p>It should build on the youth member’s passion for vertical adventures and inspire others to explore this Outdoor Adventure Skill area.</p>
<ul>
<li>What would they do again?</li>
<li>What did not work, and would they not do again?</li>
<li>What skills have they learnt?</li>
<li>Photographs are a great addition to a presentation</li>
</ul>
<h3>I have considered what I would like to do with the level of skill I have gained through the Vertical Outdoor Adventure Skills and have discussed it with a trusted mentor.</h3>
<p>The youth member could consider using their log, evidence gathered and skills gained in achieving Stages 1-9 Canyoning Outdoor Adventure Skills towards a Recognition of Prior Learning process to be considered for the relevant VET Unit of Competency, to work in the industry, to join a Scouting adventurous activities team or a range of other options for them to continue enjoying vertical adventures.</p>
