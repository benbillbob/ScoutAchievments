<ul>
<li>Human hazards</li>
<li>Environmental hazards</li>

</ul>
<p>The youth member should include in their plan what steps they will take to minimise these hazards during an activity. They should then consider the risks that may come from these hazards and how they will mitigate these on an activity. This step could be done as a Patrol or individual before a climbing trip.</p>
<ul>
<li>Human hazards</li>
<li>Environmental hazards</li>
<li>Equipment hazards</li>
</ul>
<h3>I know where to get information about climbing equipment selection.</h3>
<p>The youth member should research and provide sources of information about selecting appropriate climbing equipment.</p>
<h3>I can put together a simple climbing trip itinerary.</h3>

<h3>I can abseil using a self-belay.</h3>
<p>The youth member should demonstrate competency in safely self-belaying using a prusik hitch on an easy abseil.</p>
<h3>I always demonstrate appropriate techniques to minimise damage to the environment while climbing.</h3>
<p>The youth member should demonstrate minimising damage to the environment whilst climbing. This includes walking to the climbing location and the use of correct tree protection for any top belaying and being careful to prevent erosion on and around the cliff.</p>
<h3>I have undertaken 10 climbs by the completion of Stage 5 Climbing.</h3>
<p>The youth member needs to have attempted 10 climbs of grade 10 or higher, ideally they would have topped out on at least 5 of them. In their logbook entry the youth member should include where they did the activities, who they did them with, how high the route was, and the route difficulty (if graded).</p>
<h3>I have demonstrated climbing techniques to a Stage 3 or below Scout.</h3>
<p>The youth member should assist a Scout working on Stage 3 or below by demonstrating suitable climbing techniques.</p>
<h3>I have assisted in setting up a top rope climb.</h3>
<p>The youth member will need to set up using the appropriate knots, and ensure that a skilled person has checked the youth members set up before they test the line.</p>
<h3>I have assisted in setting up multiple types of belays for different climbs.</h3>
<p>The youth member will need to set up using the appropriate knots, and ensure that an appointed Guide has checked the youth members set up before they test the line. The different types of belays could be top belay, bottom belay or self-belay.</p>
<h3>I have belayed at least 4 Scouts on different types of belays, including 2 top rope top belays and 2 top rope bottom belays.</h3>
<p>The youth member needs to demonstrate using different belay devices, such as:</p>

<h3>I can safely escape a belay while keeping the climber safe.</h3>
<p>The youth member will need to demonstrate escaping the belay whilst minimising any movement or increasing the risk of the climber falling.</p>
<h3>I have belayed two simulated climber falls.</h3>
<p>The youth member will need to demonstrate safety for themselves and the climber stopping a fall from a climber during a mock situation.</p>
<h3>I know how to pack up a rope correctly.</h3>
<p>The youth member should demonstrate coiling a climbing rope during a climbing activity, ensuring that it is clean and dry before packing away.</p>
<h3>I understand the concepts, principles, physics and consequences of shock loading in climbing.</h3>
<p>The youth member should be able to explain and demonstrate understanding of shock loading in climbing.</p>
<h3>I have learnt two additional knots since Stage 4 that will assist me in climbing activities.</h3>
<p>The youth member should already know how to tie:</p>
<ul>
<li>Alpine Butterfly</li>
<li>Figure of 8 rethreaded</li>
<li>Double Fisherman’s</li>
<li>Tape knot</li>
<li>Prusik knot.</li>
</ul>
<p>The youth member can choose an additional two knots to learn at this Stage, remembering dressing a knot is very important. Options could be:</p>
<ul>
<li>Munter hitch</li>
<li>Rethreaded bowline with stopper</li>
<li>Clove hitch</li>
</ul>
