  <div class="stage-section-body"><h3>I can teach my group or Patrol how to prepare for a canyoning expedition.</h3>
<p>The youth member should know what is required to prepare for a single pitch canyoning expedition based on their ‘I-statements’ from Stages 1-7. The youth member should be able to effectively pass this knowledge on to other Scouts, supporting them in their skill development and learning working on a lower Stage.</p>
<p>If it has been a while since they prepared for a canyoning expedition, the youth member should brush up on their skills and look back on their previous activity reviews.</p>
<p>It is expected that the activity would go for a full one or two days at this Stage.</p>
<h3>I can plan for best practise minimal impact activities and can assist a Stage 6 Scout, or lower, on why site and activity specific minimal impact is important in canyon activities.</h3>
<p>The youth member should know what minimal impact best practice is, and be able to assist a Scout working on Stage 6 or lower the importance when canyoning. The youth member should refer to the Scout Environmental Charter and be able to discuss the following with regards to canyoning:</p>
<ul>
<li>Living sustainable lives by taking action to reduce negative impacts</li>
<li>Protecting and improving biodiversity</li>
<li>Learning about the environment and inspiring others</li>
<li>Enjoying and connecting</li>
<li>Thinking global, acting local.</li>

</ul>
<h3>I can teach another Scout how to plan a single pitch canyon trip.</h3>
<p>The youth member should know what is required to plan for a single pitch canyoning activity based on their ‘I-statements’ from Stages 1-7. The youth member should be able to effectively pass this knowledge on to another Scout, working on a lower Stage to support them in their learning. This can be a couple of hours of activity, skill development, rescue practice or supporting them to run a canyoning activity for a Patrol/ Unit of less experienced Scouts.</p>
<h3>I can plan my personal equipment and consider needs for group equipment for a multi-pitch canyon activity.</h3>
<p>The youth member should know what is required to be packed for a multi-pitch canyoning activity, taking into consideration the location and itinerary for the activity.</p>
<p>The youth member will also need to take into consideration group items which will be needed for the party such as gear, additional water, first aid items, and rescue gear. The youth member can discuss this with a skilled multi-pitch canyoner and with the Project Patrol that they will be doing this activity with.</p>

  <div class="stage-section-body"><h3>I have successfully completed the Wilderness First Aid skill set.</h3>
<p>The youth member must have completed the Wilderness First Aid skill set. This can be through a course with an accredited provider or by other means, such as Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) through SAIT or other providers. For the purposes of the Outdoor Adventure Skills, a Wilderness First Aid course consists of SIS training package’s Wilderness First Aid skillset (SISSS00126), or its replacement:</p>
<ul>
<li>HLTAID011 Provide first aid</li>
<li>SISOFLD004 Provide first aid in remote locations</li>
<li>SISXEMR002 Coordinate emergency responses.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h3>I have the ability to identify safe entry and exit from the canyon, including emergency routes.</h3>
<p>The youth member will need demonstrate the ability to identify canyon exists and emergency routes, including any additional equipment requirements within their plan. The youth member should then demonstrate exiting the canyoning through this planned route and considering alternate routes out once in the canyon.</p>
<h3>I can establish new or alternate anchors in non-routine situations or when designated anchors may not be available or suitable for use.</h3>
<p>The youth member will need to demonstrate safely establishing new or alternative anchors in a non-routine situation. The youth member should note the details in their log, including the reasons for using an alternative anchor and ensure they include a verifier’s details.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this statement this may be making an emergency anchor, replacing a damaged existing anchor, or making a new anchor in a location where one may not normally be needed.</p>
<h3>I am able to identify hazardous features of hydrological formations and determine alternative routes to avoid.</h3>
<p>The youth member should demonstrate their knowledge of hydrological formations, such as holes, stoppers, undercuts and strainers. The youth member should demonstrate determining alternative routes through the canyon to avoid these hazards.</p>
<h3>I have swum and navigated waterways in a variety of canyons.</h3>
<p>The youth member needs to complete and log canyoning activities which include swimming and navigating waterways. The youth member may need to consider what type of swimming and navigation through waterways they have done through Stages 1-7 and add some additional canyons to their experience if they don’t have much experience with this.</p>
<h3>I can determine an appropriate canyoning activity plan according to participant’s needs and characteristics and by following relevant legislation and organisational policies and procedures.</h3>
<p>The youth member should draft a plan in order to teach canyoning skills to Scouts. Their canyoning activity and teachings should be based on the group needs and the youth member should ensure they follow relevant legislation and organisational policies and procedures.</p>
<h3>I have monitored participants’ safety and performance while canyoning and can provide appropriate feedback.</h3>
<p>The youth member should demonstrate that they are able to monitor their participants safety and their skill performance when they are canyoning. The youth member should demonstrate providing effective constructive feedback where necessary for skill improvement.</p>
<h3>I have led vertical rescue drills that include self-rescue and two rescues of others including raising, lowering and a mechanical advantage system.</h3>
<p>The youth member needs to plan and lead these canyoning rescue drills, ideally with the help of a Scout working on Stage 7. The youth member should ensure they log the rescue drills indicating that they have undertaken these skills. The youth member should also include in their log where they did the canyoning activities, who they did them with and who the skilled verifier was for this activity.</p>
<h3>I have developed contingency plans for canyoning activities using detailed weather and environmental information gathered from relevant sources.</h3>
<p>The youth member should demonstrate their ability to obtain and interpret detailed weather and environmental information which is relevant to canyoning and the location they are planning to run the activity or expedition. The youth member should also include contingency plans should the weather impact on their activity.</p>
<h3>I have received feedback and can evaluate relevant aspects of a canyoning trip, and determine the level of learning achieved.</h3>
<p>The youth member should actively request feedback from the participants on canyoning activities to ascertain learnings by the participants. They should evaluate the aspects of the sessions with their participants as well as self-assess as to how the activities went and if they met the intended activity/session goals.</p>
<h3>I apply clear and accurate instructional techniques to impart activity specific knowledge, canyoning skills and safety and rescue procedures.</h3>
<p>The youth member needs to demonstrate their instructional techniques based on their activity plan they have developed. The youth member will know if they are successful in their teachings if the Scouts attending the canyoning activity understand what the youth member has told/demonstrated to them and are able to demonstrate the canyoning skills, safety and rescue procedures that the youth member has taught them, and feedback on the sessions should be a good indicator of where the youth member can improve.</p>
<h3>I have completed 25 canyons by the completion of Stage 8, four of which I have been the party leader for.</h3>
<p>The youth member needs to complete and log 25 canyoning activities, with a minimum of 4 activities that they should have planned and led. The youth member should include in their log when they did these activities, where they did the activities, who they did them with and, if they were graded, how difficult they were.</p>
