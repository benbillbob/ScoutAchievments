<li>Human hazards</li>
<li>Environmental hazards</li>
<li>Equipment hazards</li>
</ul>
<h3>I can put together a comprehensive risk assessment for a climbing activity that is coming up.</h3>
<p>The youth member should provide a risk assessment as part of their activity plan. They will need to account for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Human risk</li>
<li>Environmental risk</li>
<li>Equipment risk</li>
</ul>
<p>The youth member should also consider mitigations to reduce the risks identified.</p>
<p>This risk assessment needs to be reviewed by a skilled climber prior to the activity, with enough time that amendments can be made if required.</p>
<ul>
<li>Human risk</li>
<li>Environmental risk</li>
<li>Equipment risk</li>
</ul>
<h3>I can research the best gear for an activity application.</h3>
<p>The youth member should research and provide information about equipment selection for their climbing activity, including the reasons for their choices. If they don’t have access to the gear they would like to use after their research, then the youth member should present to their Patrol why they would prefer to use other pieces of equipment rather than needing to purchase the new gear.</p>
<h3>I can research a variety of climbing techniques and the best applications for them.</h3>
<p>The youth member should research and provide information about different climbing techniques and when they would use those techniques and why. The youth member could write down their research or speak to their Patrol/ Unit or Project Patrol about the research.</p>
<h3>I can research a variety of rescue techniques for climbing activities.</h3>

  <div class="stage-section-body"><h3>I know of hazards associated with climbing on natural surfaces and minimise risks to ensure the personal safety of participants.</h3>
<p>The youth member may research the hazards associated with climbing on natural surfaces or speak to an experienced climber about this. They then need to construct their own understanding of the risks associated and consider how they may manage these risks while climbing.</p>
<h3>I can set and use multiple anchors at the top and bottom of climbs.</h3>
<p>The youth member will need to set up multiple anchors at the top and bottom of their climbs. This could be through existing anchors like boulders, trees, bolts, etc or through them placing gear to build an anchor, by using the appropriate knots, and ensure that a skilled climber has checked their set up before they start climbing. They should include this in their log and ensure their skilled climber has been noted as the verifier.</p>
<h3>I know the difference between a dynamic and static climbing rope and can apply them to different applications of climbing.</h3>
<p>The youth member should demonstrate understanding of the difference between dynamic and static climbing ropes, and be able to discuss the different applications for using them during a climbing activity.</p>
<h3>I have belayed a climber down from a site.</h3>
<p>The youth member needs to demonstrate competently belaying a climber down from a climb, ideally on both a top and bottom belay. This should be supervised by a skilled climber.</p>
<h3>I can identify safe access to and from the climbing site.</h3>
<p>The youth member should demonstrate from their planning in Stage 5, safe access to and from the climbing site, indicating why they have chosen that route.</p>
<h3>I have set up a minimum of three different top rope climbs from start to finish including locating appropriate anchors, setting hardware and rope, setting up belays and doing final safety checks, before being the first to climb, under the supervision of a skilled person.</h3>
<p>The youth member will need to demonstrate three full climb set-ups using the appropriate anchor selection, knots, degree of rope, carabiner placement and direction of pull and ensure that a skilled climber has checked their set up before they test the lines. This should be indicated in their log and ensure their skilled climber has been noted as the verifier.</p>
<h3>I have established a belay from which the belayer is able to escape and maintain the safety of the participant.</h3>
<p>The youth member will need to demonstrate the set up and escaping the belay whilst minimising any movement of the climber. They should oversee a Stage 4 or 5 Scout escaping from belay while they keep the climber safe.</p>
<h3>I can assist to manage a climbing site with multiple ropes being used at the one time.</h3>
<p>The youth member will need to assist in managing belayers and climbers at the bottom of a cliff. The youth member should demonstrate knowledge of what is needed to be done and assist the belayers and climbers where necessary. This activity should still be overseen by a highly skilled climber.</p>
<h3>I have escaped from multiple belays while making sure the climber is still safe.</h3>
<p>The youth member will need to demonstrate at least 3 times escaping the belay whilst minimising any movement of the climber. They should indicate these skills in their log.</p>
<h3>I can complete all necessary equipment safety checks, and action unsafe equipment according to organisational policies and procedures.</h3>
<p>The youth member should demonstrate necessary equipment checks prior, during and following the activity. They should log the activity and usage in an equipment log and ensure they are following Branch or State policies as well as the adventurous activity standards.</p>

<h3>I have practiced placing traditional climbing gear, including the use of slings, quick draws, nuts, cams &amp; hexes.</h3>
<p>The youth member needs to practise placing traditional climbing gear under supervision of a skilled climber. It is recommended they practise this placement on the ground in a controlled safe manner in an instructional session where they can learn from others with peers. It’s not just about placing the gear wherever, it is about placing it correctly so there is less likelihood of failure of gear on a climb when they fall.</p>
<h3>I have completed 16 climbs by the end of Stage 6 Climbing, 5 of which are Grade 14 or higher.</h3>
<p>The youth member needs to do 16 or more climbs by the completion of Stage 6, five (5) of which need to be graded at 14 or higher in the Australian Climb Grading (or equivalent). They should include in their logbook when they did these climbs, where they did the climbs, who they did them with, how high they were and what grade they were.</p>
<h3>I can select a suitable route to climb.</h3>
<p>The youth member should discuss their chosen route and then demonstrate climbing it. This should be done in conjunction with a guide book or local knowledge of the climbs.
