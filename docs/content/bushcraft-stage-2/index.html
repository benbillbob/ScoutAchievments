  <div class="stage-section-body"><h3>I have explained what impact I can have on local vegetation while participating in activities.</h3>
<p>The impact the youth member could have on the environment is based on the decisions that they make when outdoors. To minimise their impact, they should consider staying on designated trails and areas while outdoors.</p>
<p>The youth member should understand environmental impact they could have on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Foliage</li>
<li>Disease for plants and animals</li>
<li>Landscape and erosion effects</li>
<li>Waste such as rubbish</li>
</ul>

<h3>I have discussed the appropriate action I should take in the case of an accident.</h3>
<p>Consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>DRSABCD</li>
<li>Emergency services</li>
<li>Other small accidents that may happen.</li>
</ul>
<p>The youth member should be able to discuss first steps in an emergency response following DRSABCD:</p>
<ul>
<li>Danger</li>
<li>Response</li>
<li>Send for Help</li>
<li>Airway</li>
<li>Breathing</li>
<li>CPR</li>
<li>Defibrillation.</li>
</ul>
<p>Depending on the accident sending for help could be seeking assistance from an adult or sending for emergency services.</p>

</ul>
<h3>I can discuss what safety precautions I should take before going out in the bush.</h3>
<p>Safety precautions should not restrict the purpose of the activity from being enjoyable, but should minimise as much risk exposure as possible.</p>
<p>The youth member should consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contacting the authorities or governing body of the area they will be in</li>
<li>Informing others</li>
<li>Thinking about other small accidents that may happen.</li>
</ul>
<p>The youth member should know to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make sure they have planned the activity</li>
<li>Think about what could go wrong, is there anything they can do to prevent that from happening. This is called ‘Risk assessment and mitigation’.</li>
<li>Make sure they tell someone what the plan is</li>
<li>Make sure they have a plan if something goes wrong.</li>

</ul>
<h3>I know how to contact the emergency services.</h3>
<p>The youth member understands how to contact the emergency services through the use of 000 or 112. The following information is from the Australian Government website and should be considered when the youth member answers/demonstrates this skill:
Stay focused, stay relevant, stay on the line</p>
<p>The Triple Zero (000) service is the quickest way to get the right emergency service to help you. You can contact Police, Fire, or Ambulance in life threatening or emergency situations.</p>
<p>Assess the situation</p>
<ul>
<li>Is someone seriously injured or in need of urgent medical help?</li>
<li>Is your life or property being threatened</li>
<li>Have you just witnessed a serious accident or crime?</li>
<li>If you answered YES call Triple Zero (000).</li>
</ul>
<p>Make your call</p>
<ul>
<li>Stay calm and call Triple Zero from a safe place.</li>
<li>When your call is answered you will be asked if you need Police, Fire or Ambulance. If requested by the operator, state your town and location.</li>
<li>Your call will be directed to the service you asked for. When connected to the emergency service, stay on the line, speak clear and answer the questions.</li>
<li>Don’t hang up until the operator tells you to do so.</li>
</ul>
<p>Providing location information:</p>
<ul>
<li>You will be asked where you are.</li>
<li>Try to provide street number, street name, nearest cross street and the area. In rural areas give the full address and distances from landmarks and roads as well as the property name.</li>
<li>If calling from a mobile or satellite phone, the operator may ask you for other location information.</li>
<li>If you make a call while travelling, state the direction you are travelling and the last motorway exit or town you passed.</li>

</ul>
<h3>I can state how many degrees there are on a compass and at what degrees the cardinal points are.</h3>
<p>This should be learnt and demonstrated a few times to make sure it is a known and repeatable skill.</p>
<p>There are 360 degrees on a compass. This includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>North – 360 degrees</li>
<li>East – 90 degrees</li>
<li>South – 180 degrees</li>
<li>West – 270 degrees</li>
</ul>

<li>West – 270 degrees</li>
</ul>
<h3>I know the rules for hygiene at camp.</h3>
<p>The youth member should be able to plan for and discuss the importance of:</p>
<ul>
<li>Washing (as it pertains to sickness and food hygiene)</li>
<li>Why clean surfaces are important</li>
<li>Why it’s important to have clean cooking and preparation equipment</li>
<li>How to store food correctly</li>
<li>How to keep themselves healthy (personal hygiene).</li>

  <div class="stage-section-body"><h3>I can protect myself when exposed to the sun while outdoors.</h3>
<p>The youth member should demonstrate suitable clothing for the activity and location, including understanding and demonstrating slip, slope, slap, seek and slide.</p>
<h3>I can cook a snack in a fire.</h3>
<p>The snack should be a food item that requires some preparation, and cooked on coals after a fire has been lit and burnt down to form coals. Examples include:</p>
<ul>

<li>Caramelised apples</li>
<li>Stuffed potato</li>

<h3>I know how much water I should carry when on a hike or when taking part in an outdoor activity.</h3>
<p>The youth member should be able to make a realistic estimate for how much water they need to carry on a specific outdoor activity.  The water intake should be approximately 3 litres over the full day but it will depend on a number of factors such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Temperature</li>
<li>Humidity</li>
<li>Amount of exertion</li>
<li>Individual fitness</li>
</ul>
<p>The youth member will need to demonstrate that their estimate was realistic.</p>
<ul>

<li>Humidity</li>
<li>Amount of exertion</li>
<li>Individual fitness</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Clear an effective area on the ground</li>
<li>Consider materials than can catch fire</li>
<li>Have a fire extinguishing source (i.e. water, NOT sand) close by</li>
<li>Consider digging a fire pit if land management regulations allow</li>
<li>Building a fire with appropriate natural materials</li>
</ul>

<h3>I understand the basic dangers of fire, and how to be safe around them.</h3>
<p>The youth member should be able to identify and understand the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Importance of adult supervision when surrounding fire</li>
