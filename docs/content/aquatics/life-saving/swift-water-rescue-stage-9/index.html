  <div class="stage-section-body"><h3>I know appropriate whitewater rescue techniques and common communication methods used among participants to reduce risk during activities.</h3>
<p>The youth member should be able to demonstrate knowledge of whitewater rescue techniques and communication methods by discussing this with their Patrol, in conjunction with their suitably skilled mentor. They should remember the swift water rescue principles and priorities being self, then team, then victim.</p>
<h3>I establish participants’ needs and characteristics to determine the session’s aims and objectives when facilitating a learning session.</h3>
<p>The youth member should consider their participants needs and characteristics when they are planning their learning session, so that they can ensure they meet their objectives and the aim of the session. They need to consider the location when planning their activity, to ensure that this will meet the objective too.</p>
<h3>I have kept my First Aid qualifications up to date.</h3>
<p>The youth member should keep their CPR and first aid qualifications current, by updating CPR annually and redoing their first aid course every three years.</p>

  <div class="stage-section-body"><h3>I ensure that activities are conducted safely according to participants’ needs, characteristics and teaching location.</h3>
<p>The youth member should ensure that when they are leading a swift water rescue activity that they are doing so in a safe manner and that it is based on their participants needs. They also need to consider the location they are undertaking the activity.</p>
<h3>I have participated in a rescue exercises at Stage 9 where we focus on removing submerged victims (dummy) from the bottom of a water way with some flow.</h3>
<p>The youth member should participate in rescue scenarios, safely removing submerged victims. They should always consider their surroundings and ensure that they follow safe practices when doing so. They should review their performance following the rescue and determine where they can improve next time.</p>
<h3>I have put together a substitute for a spine board for immobilizing suspected spinal injuries and, with others, practiced its use in mock situations moving participants from the water.</h3>
<p>The youth member should undertake this with their patrol in a mock emergency situation. Their substitute spine board should ensure the patient is immobilized and remains immobilized until they can get from the water to an ambulance. Their scenario needs to take into consideration the entry and exit points for their chosen location.</p>
<h3>I can demonstrate a strong understanding of different types of water ways, water movement patterns and conditions that effect water behaviour both in coastal &amp; inland conditions.</h3>
<p>The youth member should be able to demonstrate knowledge and understanding of different waterways, movement patterns and conditions in both coastal and inland conditions. This can be done through discussion with their mentor and teaching other Scouts.</p>
<h3>I have participated in rescue drills including the use of mechanical haul systems &amp; (reach, throw, row, tow, go) in moving water at this stage.</h3>
<p>The youth member should undertake water rescue drills involving the use of a mechanical haul system as well as the reach-throw-row-tow-go rescue procedure. They should note the techniques and scenario of the drills in their logbook and have it verified by a suitably skilled mentor.</p>

  <div class="stage-section-body"><h3>I can evaluate aspects of water safety training sessions I have completed and describe the kinds of personal development and learning I achieved.</h3>
<p>The youth member should discuss with their mentor or peers the personal hurdles they overcame, what they have gained an appreciation of through their water safety journey, and how they have assisted and mentored other rescuers. They should consider how they have developed across the SPICES during their journey.</p>
<h3>I have given a presentation to a group of Scouts on the skills I have gained from completing the Aquatics Outdoor Adventure Skills.</h3>
<p>The presentation should be regarding interesting, fun, challenging or unique aspect(s) about the skills they have gained while doing basic and swift water rescue training. Because of the nature of the adventurous activity, it is recommended that a presentation is very visual, exciting and inspiring, rather than a dreary or boring PowerPoint/speech. The aim is to enthuse other Scouts to take up the challenges that swift water rescue can bring.</p>
<h3>I have considered what I would like to do with the level of skill I have gained through the Aquatic Outdoor Adventure Skills and discussed it with a trusted mentor.</h3>
<p>The youth member should discuss with their mentor both their physical and mental skills that they have developed and the challenges they have overcome since deciding to start on their aquatic journey. They should consider their goals moving forward, where will water rescue take them, and how can they share these skills and learnings within their Scouting community.</p>
