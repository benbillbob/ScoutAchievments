  <div class="stage-section-body"><h3>I know how to deal with an incident, injury or illness in an outdoor location and how to summon help.</h3>
<p>The youth member should keep calm and think about the 4 A’s before starting to rescue anyone, just as they did for Stage 2.</p>
<ul>
<li>Awareness - recognising the emergency and accepting responsibility if they are able to help;</li>
<li>Assessment - decide what the best rescue technique is in the situation, which, depending on the situation, might be getting someone else to help;</li>
<li>Action - think of a plan and do but make sure they consider their personal safety</li>
<li>Aftercare - help the person until medical help arrives.</li>
</ul>
<p>The best way to rescue someone is by passing them something, such as a pool noodle, or throw something, such as a throw rope, to hold on to, so they can be pulled to safety, or thrown something to them so they can hold onto it and help them float. Every situation is different and they need to make sure they don’t end up needing rescuing too, which is why the 4A’s is a very important process to think about before starting a rescue. If the incident is non-life threatening and injury has occurred, then administer DRSABCD. If it is life-threating, then contact 000. They should also consider how they may seek help from those around them.</p>

<li>Aftercare - help the person until medical help arrives.</li>
</ul>
<h3>I can demonstrate to a group of Scouts how to safely remove an unconscious person from a body of water.</h3>
<p>The youth member should consider the rescue scenario and think about the 4A’s. Ensure they approach the unconscious person feet first, talking to them as they approach and gently tap them with their foot to see if they get a response. The scenario would depend on if they saw the incident which caused them to lose consciousness, assuming that there is no risk of spinal damage, they should roll them over and keep their face out of the water. Ideally they should use a facemask and give them rescue breaths whilst swimming them to the edge of the body of water. They may need to talk through potential scenarios with a more experienced/skilled water safety person, and run through a range of mock emergencies to build the skill required.</p>
<h3>I can identify possible hazards associated with surfing or swimming in the ocean, lake or river (wherever is applicable to you) and procedures to minimise risks.</h3>
<p>The youth member should identify the difference between a hazard and a risk. They should provide a hazard assessment and will need to account for:</p>
<ul>
<li>Human hazards</li>
<li>Environmental hazards</li>
<li>Equipment hazards</li>
</ul>
<p>They should include in their plan what steps they will take to minimise these hazards during an activity. They should then consider the risks that may come from these hazards and how they will mitigate these on an activity. This step could be done as a Patrol or individual before an ocean or large body of water trip.</p>
<ul>
<li>Human hazards</li>
<li>Environmental hazards</li>
<li>Equipment hazards</li>

  <div class="stage-section-body"><h3>I have successfully completed* a Provide First Aid (including CPR) course from a recognised provider.</h3>
<p>The youth member should complete a first aid course through an accredited provider. The first aid course should cover similar content to Provide First Aid (HLTAID011) or the current workplace first aid qualification. They could do a higher first aid unit, such as Provide Advanced First Aid or Provide First Aid in a remote location.</p>
<p>*Members under the age of 14 may be able to participate in Provide First Aid courses, but may not necessarily receive the formal Units of Competency depending on provider.</p>
<h3>I can swim 300 metres continuously using correct techniques: 100 metres freestyle, 50 metres backstroke, 50 metres breaststroke, 50 metres sidestroke, 50 metres survival backstroke.</h3>
<p>The youth member should have a two-up peer assist them in ensuring they are using the correct techniques and then add it to their logbook. This can be done in a 50 metre pool, or in open water such as an ocean, dam or river.</p>
<h3>I can perform a rescue using a long object, throwing a floatation object and weighted rope over a distance of 10 metres within a time limit of 1 minute.</h3>
<p>The youth member should demonstrate effectively rescuing a patient with the two different rescue techniques; reach rescue and throwing techniques. They should successfully recover their patient within 1 minute.</p>
<h3>I can fit a PFD correctly while treading water, swim 100 metres using survival strokes, demonstrate HELP (Heat Escape Lessening Posture) technique and climb out of the water whilst wearing the PFD.</h3>
<p>The youth member should demonstrate putting on a PFD in the water, and swim 100 metres using survival back stroke or sidestroke, then demonstrate Heat Exposure Lessening Position, which is a skill they learned in Stage 3. In their emergency scenario they could then be ‘found’ and have to climb out of the water on to the rescue boat whilst wearing their PFD.</p>
<h3>I have completed a mock incident report.</h3>
<p>The youth member should complete an incident report using their Branch’s official incident report process, based on a mock incident. If this is an online lodgement then talk to the Branch’s risk manager/incident management personnel before completing this statement, to ensure the mock incidents don’t get counted in statistics and they don’t try and follow up on the issue.</p>

  <div class="stage-section-body"><h3>I can review my own incident response performance and identify potential improvements.</h3>
<p>The youth member should think about their response to the mock emergencies and determine what they could improve upon for future incident responses, whether they are mock activities or real scenarios.</p>
