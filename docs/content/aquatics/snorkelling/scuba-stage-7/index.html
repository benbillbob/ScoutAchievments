  <div class="stage-section-body"><h3>I can explain the relative benefits of various types of equipment for diving.</h3>
<p>The youth member should research different diving equipment and the relative benefits. They should be able to explain to their Patrol those benefits. They should consider different types of suits, advantages of different types of buoyancy control devices, different materials cylinders are made from, as well as considering the local conditions and type of diving they will be doing.</p>
<h3>I can care for my diving equipment and pack it for safe travel.</h3>
<p>The youth member should demonstrate understanding of how to care for their diving equipment, such as cleaning and correct storage for safe transport. They should specifically mention usage, handling, storage and transport of SCUBA cylinders.</p>
<h3>I know what items should be in a marine First Aid kit for remote location travel as per State or Territory regulations.</h3>
<p>The youth member should be aware of what is required in their first aid kit to ensure it is suitable to assist with any particular marine injuries for the area they are diving in. They should also be able to discuss the use of oxygen for diving emergencies.</p>

  <div class="stage-section-body"><h3>I have completed the Open Water Diver Certification Course or equivalent.</h3>
<p>The youth member should successfully complete the required skills for an Open Water Diver Certification through PADI or other accredited providers.</p>
<p>An Open Water Diver Certification course will allow people aged 15 years and older to dive with a buddy to a maximum depth of 18-20 meters.</p>
<p>A junior open water certification would also be suitable if they are aged 10 - 14 years, providing that their certification allows them to dive with other certified divers.</p>
<p>Scuba Diver qualifications which restrict the diver to diving with a SCUBA professional would not be considered equivalent.</p>
<p>Typically, an open water diver course will include a minimum of four (4) open water dives.</p>
<h3>I have undertaken six additional dives after the Open Water Diver certification dive.</h3>
<p>The youth member should write these in their logbook. They should include where they did the activities, who they did it with, what the weather was like, swell and visibility as well as any other interesting information about their dive. Their dives should be in water too deep to stand up in for a minimum duration of 20 minutes or use of 100bar of air.</p>
<h3>I can navigate with a compass underwater and understand the specific challenges of underwater navigation (currents, lack of landmarks, etc.).</h3>
<p>The youth member should be able to describe the features of an underwater compass, including the lubber line, index marks and bezel. They need to discuss with their two-up peer the specific challenges they might face when undertaking navigation, and then undertake a navigational course underwater demonstrating their skills and understanding of these challenges.</p>
<h3>I have led two snorkelling activities for Scouts learning to snorkel in open water.</h3>
<p>The youth member should lead two activities this includes undertaking the planning, doing and reviewing of the activity. They should include in their plan a risk assessment, required equipment and participant gear, suitable routes, food and transportation, which are the skills they have already gained from previous stages. They should have another skilled snorkeller overseeing them leading this activity. They should make sure the skilled snorkeller verifies their logbook.</p>
<h3>I can provide assistance to a tired diver on the surface and can share my air with a diver underwater.</h3>
<p>The youth member should be demonstrating good buddy skills by assisting someone on the surface and safely sharing air with a diver underwater. These skills should be viewed by a skilled diver in a diving skills development session.</p>
<h3>I have performed two simulated rescues, showing techniques of how to approach a panicked diver on the surface.</h3>
<p>The youth member should undertake these simulated rescues and then write them in their logbook. They should always outline the scenario, their role in the rescue, what the challenges were and who was present. These skills should be viewed by a skilled diver in a diving skills development session.</p>

<section class="stage-section" data-testid="section-review">
  <button class="stage-section-toggle" type="button" aria-expanded="false">Review</button>
  <div class="stage-section-body"><h3>I have talked with Scouts from earlier Stages about my diving experience.</h3>
<p>The youth member should discuss with other Scouts, who might just have started their aquatic journeys and not yet undertaken SCUBA, about their diving trips to encourage them to pursue this skill.</p>
<h3>I can provide feedback to a Patrol of Scouts that I have led on a snorkelling trip on how we could improve in the future, considering risk management, safety, equipment management, location selection, level of difficulty, teamwork, etc.</h3>
<p>The youth member should have a review at the end of the activity and provide constructive feedback to the Scouts on how to improve the activity, including their snorkelling skills and teamwork. They should include both what went well and what could be improved. They should discuss their plan and how they could have improved upon it, considering they will be needing to do their own plans if they wish to further their knowledge on snorkelling and diving activities.</p>
