  <div class="stage-section-body"><h3>I can give a short talk to less experienced Scouts on water safety as it applies to them, in particular about keeping themselves safe.</h3>
<p>The youth member should demonstrate their understanding of water safety by giving a talk to Scouts. They should tailor their talk based on who they are talking to. Depending on the Stage those Scouts are working on, they could explain the common water safety risks and how to avoid them, different hazards in pools, lakes and rivers (Stage 3), or discuss rescue techniques with someone who has fallen in the water and cannot swim (Stages 2 &amp; 3).</p>
<h3>I can explain the hazards of taking deep breaths and holding your breath (shallow water blackout).</h3>
<p>The youth member should be aware of what can cause shallow water blackouts. They should do some research into what it is to gain a better understanding of how dangerous it is to take deep breaths and try and hold their breath underwater for too long.</p>
<h3>I am familiar with the signs and symptoms of hypothermia and hyperthermia.</h3>
<p>The youth member should be aware of the general and most common signs and symptoms of both hypothermia and hyperthermia. This could be learned through research and applied through mock emergencies. They should consider how they would avoid or prevent themselves and others getting hypothermia and hyperthermia during aquatic activities.</p>
<h3>I am able to list 5 different situations that could be classified as an emergency in an aquatic environment.</h3>
<p>The youth member should be able to list and discuss 5 different situations based on their location or a planned activity.</p>

  <div class="stage-section-body"><h3>I can swim 25 meters fully clothed before removing the clothes without touching the bottom of an open body of water.</h3>
<p>The youth member should be able to remove their clothes while treading water. This is a great skill if they fall in unexpectedly and need to remove shoes and clothing which become heavy when wet. They can do this with their bathers/swimmers under their normal clothes.</p>
<h3>I  can perform a rescue drill in the water.</h3>
<p>The youth member should demonstrate a rescue drill in the water, make sure they follow the 4A’s learned in Stages 2 &amp; 3 and then participate in a mock emergency rescue drill. They could use the situations they discussed earlier and with their Patrol and they could take turns pretending to require rescuing and then the rescuer needs to spot who is in trouble and rescue them. They can then use this drill to cover off recognising signs of a person with difficulty in the water below.</p>
<h3>I can tread water continuously for 3 minutes.</h3>
<p>The youth member should be able to tread water for 3 minutes without using any aids or touching the bottom or sides of the pool or body of water in which they are swimming.</p>
<h3>I can put on and remove a PFD in deep water.</h3>
<p>The youth member should be able to demonstrate putting on and removing a PFD when they are treading water in a body of water where they are unable to touch the bottom or sides.</p>
<h3>I can recognise other signs of a person with difficulty in water including vertical body position, gasping for air, ineffective or lack of limb movements, or remaining submerged.</h3>
<p>The youth member should be able to discuss and recognise other signs of a person with difficulty in the water. They could demonstrate their knowledge through the rescue drill scenario above. They should log their rescue in their logbook and detail what their role was in the drill and what scenarios they undertook.</p>
<h3>I have demonstrated using a buoyancy aid to support a tired swimmer and then towed the patient, maintaining clear airways.</h3>
<p>The youth member should be able to rescue and aid a tired swimmer and tow them to safety. A pool noodle is an excellent resource for supporting a tired swimmer. They should log this activity in their logbook.</p>

  <button class="stage-section-toggle" type="button" aria-expanded="false">Review</button>
  <div class="stage-section-body"><h3>I can identify where I have begun to improve my response to incidents, and where I would like to further improve.</h3>
<p>The youth member should review their rescue drills and ability to recognise distressed people in the water as well as those who are tired and need assistance and then build on those skills to see how they can improve in future.</p>
<h3>I have checked equipment for damage and discussed if it needs to be repaired or replaced.</h3>
<p>The youth member should demonstrate a gear inspection after their activity. This includes a visual inspection of any gear they used such as rescue throw bags, life rings and swimming equipment etc. They should be looking for rips, tears, cracks or holes. They should clean their gear with fresh water and chain the throw rope and let air dry in a cool dry place. If there is anything that needs repairing or replacing they should discuss it with the leader in charge of the equipment.</p>
