  <div class="stage-section-body"><h3>I am familiar with the signs and symptoms of hypothermia and hyperthermia.</h3>
<p>The youth member should be aware of the general and most common signs and symptoms of both hypothermia and hyperthermia. This could be through research and demonstrated through mock emergencies. The youth member should consider how they would avoid or prevent themselves and others getting hypothermia and hyperthermia during aquatic activities.</p>
<h3>I know the importance of not going surfing alone, and of notifying others of my plans before leaving.</h3>
<p>The youth member should always surf with a buddy, to ensure if they have a problem out on the water someone is always nearby to help them. It is also important to ensure they give someone their activity plan so others know where they are going and when they plan to come back. This means that if they don’t come back according to their plan, someone will know to send for help.</p>
<h3>I know what gear is required for a surfing adventure, including protective clothing, board and sunscreen.</h3>
<p>The youth member should consider the following when planning what gear they need:</p>
<ul>
<li>Location</li>
<li>Weather and water temperature</li>
<li>The skills and experience of their Patrol.</li>
</ul>
<p>They will definitely need a surf board but the type will depend on their preference, skill and experience. They will also probably need sun safe clothing and potentially stinger suit, or wetsuit.</p>
<ul>
<li>Location</li>
<li>Weather and water temperature</li>
<li>The skills and experience of their Patrol.</li>
</ul>
<h3>I can discuss surfer etiquette before heading out on a surf activity.</h3>
<p>The youth member should understand and observe the correct surfer etiquette whilst surfing. They can demonstrate their understanding by discussing it with their Patrol before they get into the water. They should discuss:</p>
<ul>
<li>Understanding wave priority</li>
<li>Don’t drop in or cut in front of others</li>
<li>Don’t snake or hog the waves</li>
<li>Respect the locals</li>
<li>Select surf spots according to their ability</li>
<li>Help others</li>
<li>Respect the beach and</li>
<li>Apologise if they breach the etiquette.</li>

<h3>I understand what precautions to take in regards to marine life whilst surfing.</h3>
<p>The youth member should be aware of the types of marine life local to their surfing activity. The youth member should ensure they check with lifeguards and any warning signs regarding marine life, such as sharks, red tide, blue bottles etc.</p>
<p>Minimal impact and Leave no Trace principles also apply to our oceans. They should plan ahead and prepare, dispose of waters properly, leave what they find, respect wildlife and be considerate of others. They should also be mindful of the type of sunscreen they are using, as it can affect the reefs and microorganisms in the ocean.</p>
<h3>I know what to do when I wipe out while surfing.</h3>
<p>The youth member should ensure that they know what to do and how to safely recover when they wipe out while surfing. Knowing how to wipeout properly is a key safety aspect and can make the difference between being uninjured and being injured or even drowning.</p>

  <div class="stage-section-body"><h3>I can observe surfing etiquette when catching and riding waves.</h3>
<p>The youth member should demonstrate wave priorities and the right of way. The surfer closest to the peak of the breaking wave goes first, they should be the one who has waited the longest.
If there are two surfers at the same spot then the first to their feet owns the wave.
Communication is key if it is a dual peaking wave you should call ‘left’ or ‘right’.
The youth member should know not to cut in front of other surfers, to not repeatedly paddle around someone to get the inside position, and to not hog the wave.</p>
<h3>I can trim along on unbroken, broken or peeling waves up to ½ metre deep.</h3>
<p>The youth member should be able to adjust to the shape of either an unbroken, broken or peeling wave of up to 1/2 metre deep. This is done by making small adjustments by slightly leaning their body and putting weight on either their heels or toes.</p>
<h3>I can demonstrate how to propel the board through broken and unbroken waves and flat water whilst heading out to a wave with a leg rope attached, where applicable.</h3>
<p>The youth member should demonstrate choosing the easier route paddling through ideally unbroken water to the line-up, making sure they keep out of the way of the incoming surfers.</p>
<h3>I have demonstrated correct dismount drill in both the prone and standing positions.</h3>
<p>The youth member should demonstrate correct dismount in both positions in a controlled environment, they should be able to do these safely before undertaking challenging waves.</p>
<h3>I have tried to catch a wave of around ½ meter in height.</h3>
<p>The youth member should include this detail in their logbook.</p>
<h3>I have demonstrated three times how to return to shore after being separated from my board.</h3>
<p>The youth member should include this detail in their logbook.</p>
<h3>I have completed 3 activities of surfing by the end of Stage 4 with a minimum of 3 hours in the water.</h3>
<p>The youth member needs to complete at least 3 surfing activities and ensure the details are in their logbook. Their surfing activities this includes preparation, surfing and pack up. In their log, they should include where they did the activities, who they did it with, the weather was like and any other interesting information about their activity.</p>

  <div class="stage-section-body"><h3>I have checked equipment for damage and discussed if it needs to be repaired or replaced.</h3>
<p>The youth member should demonstrate a gear inspection after their activity; visual inspection of any gear they used such as surfboard, fins, wet suit etc. They should be looking for rips, tears, cracks or holes. They should clean their gear with fresh water and chain the throw rope and let air dry in a cool dry place. If there is anything that needs repairing or replacing they should discuss it with the leader in charge of the equipment.</p>
<h3>I can identify improvements in my technique for future surfing activities.</h3>
<p>The youth member should discuss with their Patrol or Unit the surfing activities they have participated in at this stage and identify where they can improve their skills and the activities for next time.</p>
