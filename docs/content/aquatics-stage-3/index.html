  <div class="stage-section-body"><h3>I know what DRSABCD stands for and how to use it in First Aid situations.</h3>
<p>The youth member needs to be able to explain to their Patrol or their two-up peer what their understanding of the steps of DRSABCD are, and how to use it in a First Aid situation.</p>
<p>This may be done in a mock emergency situation.</p>
<h3>I can explain common water safety risks and how to avoid them.</h3>
<p>The youth member should be able to explain the common water safety risks in different environments; in pools, rivers, lakes, dams, at beaches or in the ocean.</p>
<h3>I know how to remove a cramp in my leg with a buddy’s help.</h3>
<p>The youth member should demonstrate alerting their buddy to help if necessary. They should ideally get out of the water as soon as they can, and stretch their cramped muscle and then massage the tight muscle. This can be done in a mock emergency situation with other first aid components. They could additionally discuss how to prevent getting cramps.</p>
<h3>I know how and where to get different weather forecasts for outdoor swimming activities.</h3>
<p>The youth member should demonstrate this by showing a copy of an up to date weather forecast for the area of their activity. They should be able to explain what the forecast they have found means. This could be from the Bureau of Meteorology or a local weather station. They may discuss with other Scouts different mediums where they can get the weather forecast.</p>
<h3>I know how to treat cuts and minor bleeding.</h3>
<p>The youth member should be able to explain how they would treat cuts and minor bleeding, and demonstrate their planning by bringing an appropriate personal first aid kit. This can all be completed as part of a mock emergency and first aid scenario.</p>
<h3>I can identify the different hazards between bodies of water such as pools, lakes, rivers and oceans.</h3>
<p>The youth member should be able to point out different hazards in different environments and give reasons for those hazards, such as currents, debris, rips, tides, rapids, sieves, weirs, whirlpools and waterfalls.</p>

  <div class="stage-section-body"><h3>I can put on and fit a PFD while in the water and use the Heat Exposure Lessening Position (HELP) and huddle positions.</h3>
<p>The youth member should demonstrate putting on a PFD in the water and using the Heat Exposure Lessening Position. The youth member should pull their knees together and hug them close to their chest using their arms to help prevent heat loss and reduce the risk of hypothermia. They could do this with their Patrol and huddle together in this position to conserve body heat and help rescuers find them more easily.</p>
<h3>I can swim 50 metres in a pool (using any stroke).</h3>
<p>The youth member should be able to swim 50 metres using any known swimming stroke without assistance. This means they should maintain their chosen stroke and shouldn’t touch the bottom of the pool either.</p>
<h3>I can jump feet first into water that is above my head, then swim at least 25 metres without kicking off from a side or wall.</h3>
<p>The youth member will need to demonstrate this technique in a body of water that is clear, therefore demonstrating that they know it is safe to jump in to.</p>
<h3>I can show three ways to rescue someone who has fallen into the deep water and can’t swim.</h3>
<p>The youth member should think about the 4 A’s before starting to rescue anyone, just as they did for Stage 2.</p>
<ul>
<li>Awareness - recognising the emergency and accepting responsibility if they are able to help</li>
<li>Assessment - decide what the best rescue technique is in the situation which depending on the situation might be getting someone else to help</li>
<li>Action - think of a plan and do but make sure they consider their personal safety</li>
<li>Aftercare - help the person until medical help arrives</li>
</ul>
<p>The best way to rescue someone is by passing them something, like a pool noodle, or throw something like a rope to hold on to so they pull them to safety, or throw something to them so they can hold on to it and help them float. Every situation is different and they need to make sure they don’t land up needing rescuing too, which is why the 4 A’s is a very important process to think about before starting a rescue.</p>

</ul>
<h3>I can teach the importance of the buddy system to a Scout in Stage 1.</h3>
<p>The youth member should teach a Scout working on Stage 1 the importance of the buddy system which is to ensure they keep their partner safe and help if they need it.</p>
<h3>I can tread water for 1 and a half minutes.</h3>
<p>The youth member should be able to tread water for 90 seconds without using any aids or touching the bottom or sides of the pool or body of water in which they are swimming.</p>

  <button class="stage-section-toggle" type="button" aria-expanded="false">Review</button>
  <div class="stage-section-body"><h3>I have discussed with my Patrol what I have learnt about swimming safety from two swimming trips.</h3>
<p>The youth member should review their swimming activities and about what they have learned about swimming safety from these activities, and what they want to learn about next time. They should remember to log their swimming trips in their logbook and note what they have learned about swimming safety.</p>
<h2>Verify</h2>
<h3>My logbook is up to date at the end of this stage.</h3>
