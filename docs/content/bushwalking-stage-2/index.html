  <div class="stage-section-body"><h3>I can explain what clothing I should wear whilst bushwalking.</h3>
<p>Youth member’s answer should reflect the local environment and season: The important thing is to make sure you take the time to discuss with the youth member and gain an understanding as to why they think particular fabrics and environments are appropriate:</p>
<p>Nylon: dries quickly, but not very breathable and can be hot</p>
<p>Polyester: dries quickly, can be hot</p>
<p>Cotton: suitable for summer but becomes very cold when wet.</p>
<p>Denim: heavy, cold when wet. Not a suitable outdoor fabric.</p>
<p>Wool: retains warmth when wet, but base layer can be expensive</p>
<p>Softshell: resists light rain</p>
<p>Fleece: warm but can be bulky. Durable.</p>
<h3>I have explained what impact I can have on local vegetation when bushwalking.</h3>
<p>The youth member should consider their negative impacts on the bush when walking and ways in which they can reduce though risks. these risks could include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Spreading plant diseases such as phytophthora (cinnamon fungus)</li>
<li>Spreading weed species such as dandelions</li>
<li>Physical destruction</li>
<li>Erosion</li>
<li>Litter</li>
</ul>

<h3>I have discussed the appropriate action I should take in the case of an accident or emergency.</h3>
<p>Situation-specific, but the youth member should mention:</p>
<ul>

<li>Ensuring that nobody wanders off from the group</li>
<li>Administering first aid where necessary</li>

<h3>I can use a compass to find basic directions.</h3>

<h3>I can protect myself when exposed to the sun while outdoors.</h3>

<h3>I have attended at least two short bushwalks at this stage.</h3>
<p>These may be urban bushwalks through parkland, but not solely through suburban streets or along rural roads.</p>
<h3>I can show where and when I am allowed to go, before I start bushwalking.</h3>
<p>Youth members should have conversations in their Patrol and with the activity leader, will need to point out both where on the map the group is about to walk/ where they should not walk and when on the walk should know how to protect the local habitat such as walking on the path, not standing on flowers/ natural habitat etc</p>
<p>The Patrol members abilities and needs should also be taken into consideration</p>
<h3>I have bushwalked a total distance of at least 10km.</h3>
<p>Youth members should keep a logbook of all adventures which includes distance.</p>

<p>Youth member’s answers must be relevant to bushwalking.</p>
<h3>I can suggest what I would do differently on a future bushwalk to enjoy it more, to be safer, to learn new things, or to be more challenging.</h3>
<p>Youth member’s answers must be relevant to bushwalking and could include how they can apply what they have learnt (consider using aids for this such as Review&gt; ball, SPICES cards, Method question flash cards etc).</p>

<p>The youth member should take part in a discussion with their team about their essential items, and consider:</p>
