  <div class="stage-section-body"><h3>I know how to identify food and water requirements for day trips.</h3>
<p>The youth member should consider how they might identify the needs of a particular trip, given people, location, season, and access to food and water sources. They should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Specify how much water to carry, and how often they will need to re-fill</li>
<li>Specify how many of each meal they will need (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks) and for how many people</li>
<li>Identify suitable foods for sailing with regard to energy content, durability, perishability, and deliciousness</li>
<li>Estimate overall energy requirements: How strenuous is the day?  Will it make them eat more?</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<p>They should include in their plan what steps they will take to minimise these hazards during an activity. They should then consider the risks that may come from these hazards and how they will mitigate these on an activity. This step could be done as a Patrol or individual before their sailing trip.</p>
<ul>
<li>Human hazards</li>
<li>Environmental hazards</li>
<li>Equipment hazards</li>
</ul>
<h3>I have planned a day of small boat sailing taking into consideration all personal and group equipment and all requirements for the trip.</h3>
