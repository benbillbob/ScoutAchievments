      <h1>Introduction to Scouting Overview</h1>
<h2>Plan&gt;</h2>
<h3>Introduction to Scouting</h3>
<p>This marks the beginning of your Scouting journey.</p>
<h2>Do&gt;</h2>
<h3>Helpful tips</h3>
<p>You don’t have to do this all at once, and don’t worry - it’s not a test!</p>
<p>You might also do your Introduction to the Scout Section at the same time.</p>
<p>Have a read through here before you have the discussion - then you can be ready to ask any questions you might have too!</p>
<p>Once you’ve finished both your ‘Introduction’ discussions, you’ll be welcomed into Scouting in a special ceremony called an ‘Investiture’. This marks the beginning of your Scouting journey. You’ll be given some badges for your uniform at your ceremony.</p>
<h2>Review&gt;</h2>
<h3>How to get started</h3>
<p>Every new Scout will complete an Introduction to Scouting.</p>
<p>Discuss the topics with your Unit Leader, Patrol Leader or adult Leader and track your progress here. They’ll sign you off once you’ve completed each part of the discussion.</p>
<p>This will help you understand who we are as Scouts, and about the adventures to come.</p>
