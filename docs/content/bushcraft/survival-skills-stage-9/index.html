  <div class="stage-section-body"><h3>I have kept my First Aid qualifications up to date.</h3>
<p>The youth member should have kept their CPR and first aid certification up to date through an accredited provider (including wilderness first aid).</p>
<h3>I have organised at least three survival skills camps for other Scouts.</h3>
<p>The youth member should have organised at least three camps of at least one night each which focus primarily on survival skills for other Scouts who are working on achieving their Outdoor Adventure Skill Stages.</p>
<p>The camps should be designed to address the requirements of more than one Stage.</p>
<p>The youth member should be considering organising these camps for other Sections too.</p>
<h3>I have mentored a Scout in a lower Stage to build and use an improvised water filter.</h3>
<p>The youth member should be able to teach a lower-Stage Scout to improvise a water filter from materials at hand in a survival situation. The youth member will need to ensure that the other Scouts understand the need to purify water once filtered using various methods such as boiling water.</p>

  <div class="stage-section-body"><h3>I have been part of a Patrol on an evacuation simulation exercise of a patient being carried on an improvised stretcher for roughly 1km.</h3>
<p>The youth member should be involved in a day search and rescue exercise for Scouts in bushland or similar terrain.</p>
<p>This should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Writing the scenario</li>
<li>Developing a risk management plan</li>
<li>Obtaining permits and liaising with land managers and local police</li>
<li>Setting search area boundaries</li>
<li>Partaking in the search exercises/s</li>
<li>Reviewing the search and rescue scenario</li>

</ul>
<h3>I have facilitated a Stage 7 or below Scout in how to find and use edible plants, insects &amp; fish in cooking.</h3>
<p>The youth member should be able to assist with finding and identifying flora, insects, and fish, and knowing what each can be used for. In particular, they should have a good knowledge of which species are hazardous or poisonous in their local area.</p>
<h3>I have designed and built with other scouts a long term survival shelter big enough for a Patrol.</h3>
<p>The youth member should design and build a shelter which could be suitable for at least a week’s occupation. It should be large enough to sleep four people without being squashed together.</p>
<p>The Patrol could be of Scouts at different Stages and could assist them in elements of their Stage competencies and skill development.</p>
<p>For example, as part of the requirements of Survival Stage 4; use artificial rope or cord, and may use cut spars from the Group stores, but all other materials must be natural, for example wood, fibres, vines, leaves, bracken, stones, or mud.</p>
<p>It might be worthwhile to include some Pioneering Stage 8 Scouts in the Patrol as they will have experience making ropes from natural materials.</p>
<p>The youth member needs to ensure they receive landowners permission and undertake the necessary planning including risk assessments.</p>
<h3>I have developed a plan for a groups survival in a large scale natural emergency.</h3>
<p>The youth member could consider researching and design of Flood, Fire, Earthquake or other natural disaster Plan.</p>

  <div class="stage-section-body"><h3>I have given a presentation to a group of Scouts on how I have gained skills from completing the Bushcraft Outdoor Adventure Skills.</h3>
<p>The presentation should be a review of their Stage 1-9 journey through Outdoor Adventure Skills - Bushcraft Survival.  It should cover planning and design of some survival camps and activities that the youth member has led and assisted with and associated learnings. The presentation itself could be in any form, a video blog, PowerPoint presentation, visual or verbal presentation bearing in mind that the aim of the presentation is to encourage those that watch it to be inspired to create some unique and exciting survival activities.</p>
