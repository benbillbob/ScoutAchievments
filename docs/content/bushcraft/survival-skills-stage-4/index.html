  <div class="stage-section-body"><h3>I know how to protect the environment when building shelters and lighting fires.</h3>
<p>When planning a shelter building activity/survival camp, the youth member needs to consider how they are going to protect the environment around them. This could include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Trees</li>
<li>Habitats for animals</li>
<li>Waterways</li>
<li>Macro ecosystems</li>
<li>Waste management</li>
</ul>
<p>How will the youth member manage and protect these aspects, or any others which are identified?</p>
<ul>
<li>Trees</li>
<li>Habitats for animals</li>
<li>Waterways</li>
<li>Macro ecosystems</li>
<li>Waste management</li>
</ul>
<h3>I can prepare equipment for safe transportation to activity location.</h3>
<p>The youth member should be able to determine necessary equipment for their survival activity and plan the packing accordingly, in a trailer or vehicle, ensuring it is suitably secure to minimise any accidents for objects such as axes, spars, fuel, and other sharp objects.</p>
<h3>I can understand the plan for a survival activity and what I am required to plan for.</h3>
<p>The youth member needs to provide a suitable plan for the chosen survival activity. Their plan should include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Purpose and outcomes</li>
<li>Who is attending</li>
<li>Weather considerations</li>
<li>Gear lists</li>
<li>Emergency management plan</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<h3>I can think of five things I would want in my survival kit.</h3>
<p>The youth member should extend from what is already in their survival kit from Stage 3. They should consider, depending on environment, what are the five things they would not want to be caught out without, so they can consider these items for inclusion in their kit moving forward.</p>

  <div class="stage-section-body"><h3>I am familiar with the signs and symptoms of hypothermia and hyperthermia.</h3>
<p>The youth member should be aware of the general and most common signs and symptoms. This could be learned through mock emergencies and research.</p>
<h3>I can signal for help from the ground where the help will come from the air.</h3>
<p>The youth member needs to demonstrate their ability to signal a light aircraft for help. This can be done through a mock emergency and they could use, but are not limited to, the following techniques:</p>
<ul>
<li>Three smoke fires</li>
<li>Writing large letters on sand/mud</li>
<li>Arranging tree branches, rocks, or natural materials to form letters or symbols</li>
<li>Using a V-sheet</li>
<li>Using a mirror</li>

</ul>
<h3>I can identify the fire triangle and how its elements create fire.</h3>
<p>The youth member should be able to demonstrate their knowledge of the fire triangle and how the three sides of the triangle (fuel, heat, oxygen) form a chemical reaction creating a fire.</p>
<h3>I can properly extinguish a campfire through a variety of means in a camp environment.</h3>
<p>The youth member should have demonstrated a safe way of extinguishing a campfire and explain what they are doing to mitigate future risks of the fire re-lighting.</p>
<h3>I have lit a fire in dry and wet conditions.</h3>
<p>The youth member should have demonstrated their ability to light a fire on more than one occasion, including at least once in wet weather. In areas where there is little chance of actual wet weather within a reasonable period, then damp wood may be substituted to ensure they are able to achieve this ‘I statement’.</p>
<h3>I have tried different ways to purify water for drinking and can talk about when it is appropriate to do so.</h3>
<p>The youth member should have attempted the following methods of purifying water:</p>
<ul>
<li>Boiling</li>
<li>Evaporation and condensation (this may be done concurrently)</li>
<li>Filtration through leaves, grass, sand, rocks and charcoal</li>
<li>Using coffee filters or similar common camping goods.</li>
</ul>
<p>Alternatively purifying through different types of purchasable water purifiers is ok.</p>

<li>Using coffee filters or similar common camping goods.</li>
</ul>
<h3>I have built an emergency shelter big enough for three, made of rope and materials found outdoors, and I have slept out in it for one night.</h3>
<p>The youth member needs to construct the shelter in company with a Patrol. The rope may be a manufactured rope or cord of any size; they don’t need to make the rope from natural materials. The shelter should be constructed using a range of materials such as bark, palm fronds, vine, branches and mud as well as any man made products the Patrol has with them in what would be classed as an ‘emergency scenario’. They need to ensure that by using these materials they are not damaging the environment.</p>
<h3>I can orientate a map to the surrounding landscape with and without a compass.</h3>
<p>The youth member needs to be able to demonstrate correct map orientation using a compass and using landscape features.</p>
<h3>I can estimate distance travelled while on a Scouting activity without electronic means.</h3>
<p>The youth member could use NAISMITH’s rule to calculate extended distance in a time, or they could be able to roughly estimate a distance travelled cross-country. The distance travelled should be at least 100 metres and they should be within 20%. It is recommended that they calibrate their pace length against a known distance beforehand. They could use beads or pebbles, or any other  non-electronic and non-written method to keep track of paces.</p>
<h3>I have discussed the basic survival skills and why each one is important.</h3>
<p>Basic survival skills are shelter building, finding water and finding food. The youth member could discuss their understanding of the survival ‘rule of 3’s’:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can survive for 3 minutes without air.</li>
<li>You can survive for 3 hours without shelter in a harsh environment (therefore basic survival skills you will need to be able to build a suitable shelter to protect you from the elements)</li>
<li>You can survive for 3 days without water (therefore you should be able to find and purify water to survive)</li>
<li>You can survive for 3 weeks without food.</li>
</ul>
<p>The youth member needs to be aware that these rules are a general averages only and just because they survive doesn’t mean the outcome is good for the individual.</p>

  <div class="stage-section-body"><h3>I can identify where I can improve my survival skills for the next time I try a survival challenge.</h3>
<p>The youth member should discuss with their Patrol or Unit the survival skills they have learned at this Stage and identify where they can improve their skills for next time.</p>
<h3>I have checked equipment for damage and discussed if it needs to be repaired or replaced.</h3>
<p>The youth member should also be keeping a log of what equipment was used during their activities. Ensure that it is packed away and stored correctly. If anything is damaged or needs replacing, note it in a log and discuss with Unit Council.</p>
