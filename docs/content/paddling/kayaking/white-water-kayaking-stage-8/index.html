  <div class="stage-section-body"><h3>I can teach another youth how to pack for a whitewater kayaking expedition.</h3>
<p>The youth member should be able to effectively pass this knowledge on to another Scout, working on a lower stage. If it has been a while since they prepared for whitewater kayak expedition they should brush up on their skills and look back on their previous activity reviews. They will know if they are successful in their teachings if that Scout is able to demonstrate preparing for whitewater kayak expedition.</p>
<h3>I can teach another youth how to plan a kayaking trip in unfamiliar territory using the appropriate tools.</h3>
<p>The youth member should be able to effectively pass this knowledge on to another Scout, working on a lower stage. If it has been a while since they prepared for whitewater kayak expedition they should brush up on their skills and look back on their previous activity reviews. They will know if they are successful in their teachings if that Scout is able to demonstrate preparing for whitewater kayak expedition.</p>
<h3>I have assisted in the organisation of an instructional session to teach other scouts basic kayaking skills.</h3>
<p>The youth member needs to assist in the drafting of a plan in order to teach basic whitewater kayak skills to Scouts. Their kayak activity and teachings should be based on the group needs which are likely to be skills such as entering and exiting low flow river eddys, fairy gliding, support strokes and kayak rolling practice.</p>
<h3>I can make recommendations to improve group equipment in a whitewater environment.</h3>
<p>The youth member should be able to use their experience and knowledge gained over the last 7 Stages to recommend improvements to the groups white water expedition equipment based on their needs and the objectives of the activities planned.</p>
<h3>I can identify the uses of mechanical advantages systems in whitewater environments.</h3>
<p>The youth member should be able to identify a situation which requires the use of a mechanical advantage and then determine which type of system is required. They could use z drags, pig-rigs, vector pulls, 3:1 ratio or even 4:1 ratios. It may be worth practicing the different types on land to see how they work.</p>

  <div class="stage-section-body"><h3>I can recognise a rapid that is beyond my skill level to run.</h3>
<p>The youth member is required to recognise the different grades of rapids and from experience know their limitations.</p>
<h3>I can rescue a capsized loaded kayak in different whitewater environments.</h3>
<p>The youth member is required demonstrate how to deal with a loaded kayak. They will need to; assess and identify potential hazards and risks, choose a rescue method suitable for the situation and ensure they communicate with their group. They should demonstrate this skill in a couple of different environments such as different grades of rapids or different weather conditions. They need to log their rescues and ensure they include a description as to the conditions and what they did during the rescue.</p>
<h3>I can get swimmers to safety in a whitewater environment.</h3>
<p>The youth member is required to demonstrate in a rescue scenario the ability to get a swimmer to safety in a whitewater environment. They should demonstrate using a throw rope or bag to then tow them to safety and swimming in moving water to find, rescue and tow a patient out of harms way.</p>
<h3>I have been involved in a whitewater rescue drill which includes the use of a mechanical advantage system.</h3>
<p>The youth member is required to put into practice their skills to identify a situation which requires the use of a mechanical advantage on the water. Their rescue scenario could use z drags, pig-rigs, vector pulls, 3:1 ratio or even 4:1 ratios. They need to log their rescue drill describing the methods used and the environment it occurred in.</p>
<h3>I can efficiently and safely port my kayak around a rapid.</h3>
<p>The youth member is required to demonstrate either carrying their kayak over shallow rapids, or around the rapids depending on the situation and ensuring that they unload it if necessary.</p>
<h3>I have successfully completed the Wilderness First Aid skill set.</h3>
<p>The youth member must have completed the Wilderness First Aid skill set. This can be through a course with an accredited provider or by other means, such as Recognition of Prior Learning (RPL) through SAIT or other providers. For the purposes of the OAS, a Wilderness First Aid course consists of SIS training package’s Wilderness First Aid skillset (SISSS00126), or its replacement:</p>
<ul>
<li>HLTAID011 Provide first aid</li>
<li>SISOFLD004 Provide first aid in remote locations</li>
<li>SISXEMR002 Coordinate emergency responses.</li>

</ul>
<h3>I can effectively demonstrate cutting in and out of eddies &amp; currents in my kayak.</h3>
<p>The youth member is required to demonstrate cutting into and out of an eddy from slow to medium flow water. If demonstrated correctly they will not capsize their kayak and all members of the group and other boats will remain safe and injury free during this task. They will also need to demonstrate cutting in and out of changing currents.</p>
<h3>I can demonstrate kayak rolls in Grade 2 rivers.</h3>
<p>The youth member is required to demonstrate safe and efficient rolling in Grade 2 rivers. This could be in a Grade 2 rapids or in fast flowing water in the general flow of the river (this should depend on skill of the paddler).</p>
<h3>I have undertaken at least 6 days of whitewater paddling in grade 2 water or above by the end of Stage 8.</h3>
<p>The youth member needs to complete and log at least 6 days of whitewater kayaking by the end of this Stage. They need to include this in their log along with, when they did the activities, where they did the activities, who they did the activities with, what the conditions and grade the rivers were and any additional rapid features.</p>

  <div class="stage-section-body"><h3>I can review my own whitewater kayaking performance and identify potential improvement.</h3>
<p>The youth member should be able to identify and review areas in which they can improve on when white water kayaking. They may film themselves practicing skills such as strokes or rescues to assist in this review. They should also be receptive to feedback from others to help them improve.</p>
<h3>I can provide instruction and feedback to a patrol of Scouts who are planning to experience whitewater kayaking.</h3>
<p>The youth member is required to provide guidance and instruction to a Patrol of Scouts who are planning to experience whitewater kayaking. They will also need to engage the Patrol’s readiness and skill levels during this phase.</p>
