<h3>I have considered what I would like to do with the level of skill I have gained through the Paddling Outdoor Adventure Skills, and discussed it with a trusted mentor.</h3>
<p>The youth member should consider what they would like to do with the level of skill they have gained throughout the Outdoor Adventure Skills Stages of Paddling.

These could include a job in the industry, accrediting their youth program skills through Scouts Australia Institute of Training (SAIT), joining a paddling club or helping out with a Scouting activities team to support more youth through the Outdoor Adventure Skills. It’s the youth member’s personal journey.</p>
