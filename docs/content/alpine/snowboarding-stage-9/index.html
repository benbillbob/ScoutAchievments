<p>The youth member needs to have kept their CPR and first aid qualifications current, by updating CPR annually and redoing their first aid course every three years or as required for their wilderness skill set.</p>
<h3>I can develop a detailed risk management plan for a snowboarding and/or skiing trip with a Unit, involving challenging terrain skiing and spanning three days or more, including potentially dangerous weather hazards.</h3>
<p>The youth member will have done a detailed trip plan in Stage 7 and assisted Scouts in Stage 8 to plan ski and/or snowboard tours. They need to demonstrate further research and revision of their previous detailed risk management plans to include challenging terrain and dangerous weather hazards for a period of three (3) or more days.</p>
<h3>I have planned my dream international snowboarding experience, including all logistical and activities planning.</h3>
<p>The youth member should be well versed in planning overnight experiences by this stage, based on their ‘I’ statements from Stages 1-8.

They should take into consideration transport, emergency contingency plans, participants, food and accommodation.</p>
<h3>I have planned to run an alpine sport skills day for a Unit or Group.</h3>
<p>The youth member should put their planning experience that they have been developing over the last eight (8) stages into practice and lead a snowboarding skills development day for their Unit or Group.</p>

<h3>I have continued to develop my snowboarding skills and can show two new snowboarding skills that I have learned during Stage 8 and Stage 9.</h3>
<p>The youth member needs to review the two (2) new skills which they decided to learn in Stage 8 and continue to practice them.</p>
<h3>I have snowboard off-piste on four different occasions.</h3>
<p>The youth member is required to have participated in at least four (4) snowboarding sessions on off-piste terrain on different occasions by the end of this stage. They should log their activities and include their role in the activity (did they participate, assist or lead), the skills demonstrated, where they did their snowboarding, who they were with and what they learned during the trips. They could also include photographs of the trips.</p>
<h3>I have undertaken at least 30 days of snowboarding by the end of Stage 9.</h3>
